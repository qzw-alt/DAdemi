> "This structure really is about defining a movement, and that's very different from, 'Hey, I'm going to solve your problem.'"

**Insight:** Strategic storytelling focuses on leading a movement rather than just solving a functional problem.

**Tactical advice:**

> "The third piece is what I call naming the object of the new game... I find that what's the object of the new game really boils it down as kind of the rallying cry of the movement. So the example with Zuora, the object for a while was turn customers into subscribers."

**Insight:** A brand needs a 'rallying cry' that defines the ultimate goal of the new market reality.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a 'buyer mission statement' or rallying cry (e.g., Airbnb's 'Belong Anywhere').
- Try framing the object of the game as a question to engage the prospect.

> "what we want to do then is, okay, we've got this positioning, now let's put it together into a sales narrative that we can then take and test with qualified prospects and make sure it works, but we've also got something that the sales team can pitch and oh, by the way, everybody else knows how to tell the story too."

**Insight:** Positioning must be translated into a structured sales narrative to be actionable for the field and consistent across the company.

**Tactical advice:**
- Storyboard the positioning into a narrative before creating decks
- Create a script or demo that reflects the core positioning story

*Arielle Jackson*

> "Your brand is who people think you are and developing a brand strategy is what do you want to be? What do you want people to think you are? And what are you going to do to help shape that perception?"

**Insight:** Brand is the external perception of a company, and strategy is the intentional effort to shape that perception.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define purpose, positioning, and personality as the core of brand strategy
- Use brand strategy to inform visual design and tone of voice

*Timestamp: 00:34:33*

---

> "Your purpose is why you do what you do. It makes people want to root for you. And it has a big role in aligning people to come want to work for you and to have employees all feel like they're part of something. I like to think of it as we exist to blank."

**Insight:** A company's purpose should be a 10-year North Star that explains the change the company wants to see in the world.

**Tactical advice:**
- Draft a purpose statement starting with 'We exist to...'
- List cultural tensions in the world to find a relevant purpose
- Ensure the purpose is independent of financial gain

*Timestamp: 00:42:50*

> "Strong brand spike in two of the five [dimensions]... sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication, and ruggedness... you want to write them as statements that say we are X, but not Y, where Y is taking X too far. So in the example Google is playful but not silly."

**Insight:** Defining a brand personality requires choosing specific dimensions to 'spike' in and creating guardrails to prevent those traits from becoming negative.

**Tactical advice:**
- Select two of the five dimensions of brand personality to focus on
- Create five 'X but not Y' personality attributes to create healthy tension
- Use these attributes to guide ad copy and illustration styles

## Bob Moesta
*Bob Moesta 2.0*

> "This actually comes from Pixar. The way Pixar actually does its films is it has to come back with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, statements around it... It's this notion of once upon a time... every day... one day... because of that... until finally... and ever since that day."

**Insight:** Using a narrative framework like Pixar's story spine helps candidates communicate their career journey and value proposition concisely.

**Tactical advice:**
- Structure your career summary using the 'Once upon a time... Every day... One day... Because of that...' template.
- Focus the 'One day' moment on the realization of your unique superpower or the reason for your current career pivot.

## Brandon Chu
*Brandon Chu*

## Brian Chesky
*Brian Chesky*

> "When we're working on a launch, one of the first things we'll do is start figuring out what the story is. And the story will often dictate the product. Because ultimately you have to tell the story to people. But a story also is a really helpful way to develop a cohesive product."

**Insight:** Start with the narrative to ensure the final product is cohesive and easy for customers to understand.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define the product story before finalizing the product
- Use the story as a guide for cohesive development

## Camille Ricketts
*Camille Ricketts*

> "painting an emotional picture of the vision that he was really going after and being able to convey the emotional quality of the mission to the people he talked to. So definitely at the time about the electric vehicle revolution and then space travel, I think he just knew how to make people feel about it that really enlisted a lot of hearts and minds"

**Insight:** Effective brand storytelling involves painting an emotional picture of the vision to enlist 'hearts and minds.'

**Tactical advice:**
- Convey the emotional quality of the mission, not just the technical details
- Use vision to make people feel something about the future you are building

*Timestamp: 00:05:59*


## Chip Huyen
*Chip Huyen*

> "When we write something we care about how users would feel across a story... care about character likeability... you put in some vulnerability sometimes it's like okay maybe it's person have setback."

**Insight:** Effective storytelling requires managing the 'emotional journey' of the audience and building likeability through vulnerability.

**Tactical advice:**
- Map the emotional journey of the narrative to avoid 'emotional exhaustion' in the reader
- Build character likeability by showing setbacks and vulnerability rather than just competence

*Timestamp: 01:19:05*


## Christina Wodtke
*Christina Wodtke*

> "If you tell people a bunch of facts, they'll forget most of them... But if you tell them a story that's full of facts, they will remember it... stories are very powerful. I think images are very powerful."

**Insight:** Storytelling is a biological necessity for retention and comprehension, making it a critical tool for business alignment.

**Tactical advice:**
- Wrap data and facts inside a narrative to ensure they are remembered by the team.
- Use simple drawings to create a shared mental model and avoid the abstraction of words.

*Timestamp: 00:41:38*

> "structurally there's a beginning, middle, and end. Intrigue people with a hook, a mystery. That's the beginning, right? A mystery, a secret, a surprise. The middle is... where you get your message in. And the end is always going to be success and celebration"

**Insight:** A simple three-part structure—hook, message, and successful conclusion—is the most effective way to communicate business ideas.

**Tactical advice:**
- Start every presentation or pitch with a 'hook' (a mystery, secret, or surprise) to get attention.
- Always end stories with success and celebration to leave the audience excited.

*Timestamp: 00:44:00*


## Elena Verna
*Elena Verna 4.0*

> "One of our biggest strategy is building in public, and it's coupled with employee socials, founder-led socials."

**Insight:** Building in public creates a human connection and maintains market 'noise' that acts as a re-engagement strategy.

**Tactical advice:**
- Encourage founders and employees to post authentically on X and LinkedIn to show the 'humanity' behind the software.
- Use daily shipping updates to stay top-of-mind for users without relying on traditional newsletters.

*Timestamp: 00:00:50*

---

> "I talk to my designer all the time, how can we add more love marks into the product? How can we prioritize more unique interactions? The little elements that make up that feeling of this product is speaking to me... we put all of the brand work actually into our product."

**Insight:** Brand storytelling should be embedded directly into the product UI and interactions rather than just external marketing.

**Tactical advice:**
- Prioritize 'love marks' and unique micro-interactions that communicate the brand's personality.
- Focus on the emotional feel of the software to differentiate in a crowded utility market.

*Timestamp: 00:33:40*

---

> "Storytelling is a big portion of it actually to stick."

**Insight:** Effective storytelling is essential for making insights 'stick' and ensuring they are digested by the audience.

**Tactical advice:**

## Emilie Gerber
*Emilie Gerber*

> "It's identifying the piece of the story that's most interesting and then doubling down on that... figuring out how to tie it to these things that people actually care about, and not just the company's messaging I think is our job."

**Insight:** Effective storytelling for press involves connecting company news to broader macro trends or public interests.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the 'nugget' of the story that is most interesting to the general public
- Tie product news to current events or industry-wide problems

*Timestamp: 00:47:35*

---

> "Having something pretty controversial to say... we really push our clients to have something unique and different and bold to say. And it obviously has to be a strategic decision for the business... but there are I think instances where it can make a lot of sense to say something that's a little bit bold and controversial."

**Insight:** Contrarian or bold opinions are more likely to get picked up by reporters looking for a balanced or unique angle.

**Tactical advice:**
- Take a stance that opposes a popular trend if it's strategically sound
- Pitch 'gaps' in current coverage by offering a different perspective

*Timestamp: 00:36:25*


## Gina Gotthilf
*Gina Gotthilf*

> "The importance of building a lovable brand that really resonates with people and makes people feel something and want to stand behind an idea that's bigger than themselves is not easy to do, but possible and core to being able to increase word-of-mouth."

**Insight:** A lovable brand is built on a mission that users can rally behind, which naturally drives organic growth.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify a mission or 'bigger idea' that resonates emotionally with the target audience.
- Use the brand to make users feel like they are part of something larger than just a product transaction.

*Timestamp: 00:46:19*

---

> "If you're able to tell a story about people whose lives are completely transformed or something like that, that's much more interesting and has played an important role in, honestly, my work at Tumblr, at Duolingo... definitely Latitude as well."

**Insight:** Transformation stories are more compelling for PR and brand building than simple growth metrics.

**Tactical advice:**
- Pitch stories of human transformation to media rather than just business milestones.
- Focus social media content on the impact the product has on lives.

*Timestamp: 00:48:02*


## Grant Lee
*Grant Lee*

> "I think part of founder-led marketing is going through this yourself. I think a lot of founders are trying to be more active on social media. And I think if you can overcome the initial cringe factor of seeing yourself and postings like, oh, this doesn't feel authentic, if you can overcome that initial feeling, you start investing into like, okay, how do I become a better copywriter? How do I articulate something that is clear, not just clever?"

**Insight:** Founders must personally master copywriting and storytelling to establish the brand's voice and set a high bar for future marketing hires.

**Tactical advice:**
- Practice copywriting to ensure communication is clear rather than just clever.
- Bank 'goodwill' by sharing valuable content for a long time before asking for anything in return.
- Keep a log of unintuitive lessons and observations to turn into content.

*Timestamp: 00:28:27*


## Gustaf Alstromer
*Gustaf Alstromer*

> "Finally, what I would say is the skill that's really attributed to great founders is excellent communication skills. So the ability to communicate really complicated ideas clearly... I would say communication or storytelling is part of the same arc, right? And those are part of the same thing that actually motivates people around you."

**Insight:** Storytelling is a core leadership skill used to simplify complexity and inspire teams and investors.

**Tactical advice:**
- Practice communicating complicated technical ideas in clear, simple narratives

*Timestamp: 00:42:29*


## Jason Feifer
*Jason Feifer*

> "Success stories are not interesting. They're not interesting to anybody. It's not useful for you to hear that someone else succeeded. What's useful is for you to hear how someone else faced challenges that you faced. And got through them so that you can see. Aha, that's an interesting strategy to use for me. I hate success stories. I love problem solving stories."

**Insight:** Audiences and editors value 'problem-solving' narratives over 'success stories' because they provide relatable, actionable lessons.

**Tactical advice:**
- Frame your brand story around a specific problem you faced and the counterintuitive way you solved it.
- Be open about challenges and vulnerabilities during interviews to build a more compelling 'hero's journey' narrative.

*Timestamp: 01:04:42*

---

> "Sometimes you are not the story, but you can be part of the story. Sometimes that means if Fred stumbled into it, but I get plenty of people who've reach out and maybe they have a real estate startup and there's something really interesting happening in the real estate space and they reach out and they tell me about this really interesting thing that's happening in the real estate space and the role that they happen to play in it."

**Insight:** You can gain brand visibility by positioning your company as a character or expert within a larger industry trend or problem.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify a 'gigantic scam' or industry-wide problem your company is caught up in and pitch that larger story to journalists.
- Use your company's internal data to create reports (like the 'Corcoran Report') that establish you as an authority on industry trends.

*Timestamp: 01:23:46*


## Jonathan Becker
*Jonathan Becker*

> "In a pitch situation you want to tell a story, it's important, and that story has to have a beginning, middle, and end... be brave and tell them what they need rather than just conforming to what they're asking for because sometimes inadvertently that leads you down the wrong path."

**Insight:** Effective storytelling in high-stakes environments requires a clear narrative structure and the confidence to challenge the audience's assumptions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Structure pitches with a clear beginning, middle, and end
- Identify the underlying need of the stakeholder rather than just answering their explicit questions

*Timestamp: 01:24:38*


## Ken Norton
*Ken Norton*

> "The art is communication, collaboration, the more fuzzy, softer skills, people stuff... do some training about storytelling. These are all really, really important factors that start to come into play."

**Insight:** Storytelling is a critical 'art' of product management that facilitates persuasion and alignment.

**Tactical advice:**
- Seek out specific training in storytelling to complement technical PM skills

*Timestamp: 00:47:25*


## Karri Saarinen
*Karri Saarinen*

> "To me, I think the brand should be always authentic and it should, I think even if people can't articulate it, if people start to feel like something is off... you create it over time by the things you do, the things you say, how you say them and how do you approach things, how do you treat customers, how do you build the website or the product?"

**Insight:** Brand is the sum of every interaction a customer has with the company, from the landing page to customer support.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ensure the brand voice is consistent across the product, marketing, and support interactions.
- Focus on authenticity rather than emulating the brand styles of other successful companies.

*Timestamp: 01:30:59*


## Kevin Aluwi
*Kevin Aluwi*

> "I'm a very big believer that the two most important things in a consumer business are product and brand in that order. And I don't think I need to sell the idea, especially to your audience. That product is absolutely critical and probably the most important. But brand as an afterthought is definitely one of the areas where I think there's a giant missed opportunity for consumer tech businesses."

**Insight:** Brand is a critical pillar for consumer businesses that creates identity-based loyalty beyond transactional utility.

**Tactical advice:**
- Prioritize brand as a core pillar alongside product rather than an afterthought
- Aim to create associations that transcend transactional relationships to become part of a user's identity

*Timestamp: 00:17:16*

---

> "I think for us, we invested a lot in our brand across multiple areas. And I think one specific area that I think is really important is that you create consistency across all customer touchpoints. And so branding is not just cool logo, cool advertising, fun imagery, but it's really about the impression that a customer or user has with your product and with your business."

**Insight:** Branding is the sum of all customer touchpoints and requires consistency across copy, design, and service experience.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ensure consistency across all customer touchpoints, including in-app copy and advertising
- Think of branding as the total impression a user has of the business, not just visual assets

*Timestamp: 00:19:45*

---

> "The jackets and helmets piece I think is really, really important for two reasons. One, the more obvious reason, which is that because they were just all over the streets of many cities in Indonesia, people were familiar with the imagery and the names, but I think it's also really important that people saw what was happening... it was like this beautiful combination of one just having that imagery and having that visual everywhere as a reminder of the brand. But more importantly, it was also a physical reminder of the service of what we do and of how we can help you."

**Insight:** Physical branding assets are most effective when they simultaneously build brand recall and demonstrate the product's value proposition in real-time.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use physical branding (like uniforms or equipment) to provide a constant visual reminder of the service
- Look for opportunities where branding can physically reinforce the value proposition (e.g., seeing a driver bypass traffic)

*Timestamp: 00:23:08*


## Laura Modi
*Laura Modi*

> "I now reflect back on just how powerful our storytelling was at Airbnb to get people pumped up. I mean, even for some of the smallest features that we would build, Lenny, they would kick off with the most powerful storytelling. I mean, we were changing lives. And again, it makes you wake up every day going, 'Fuck, yeah, I want to work on this.'"

**Insight:** Powerful storytelling connects daily tasks to a larger mission, driving employee motivation.

**Tactical advice:**
- Kick off feature launches with stories that highlight the human impact of the work.
- Ensure the narrative of 'changing lives' is felt throughout the entire organization.

*Timestamp: 00:09:16*


## Lulu Cheng Meservey
*Lulu Cheng Meservey*

> "The overall principle is you have to make it memorable and you have to make people want to say it of their own volition... You can make it into a joke... You can use an analogy... You can create a mental image that is very colorful... use a story, use an anecdote instead of using adjectives because adjectives are so subjective, they're meaningless to people."

**Insight:** Memorable stories spread when they provide social currency to the teller, such as making them appear funny, interesting, or helpful.

**Tactical advice:**
- Turn ideas into repeatable lines or jokes.
- Use colorful mental images (e.g., 'put the pill in some cheese').
- Replace subjective adjectives with concrete anecdotes that people can repeat at a dinner table.

*Timestamp: 00:05:03*


## Matthew Dicks
*Matthew Dicks*

> "Every story is about a singular moment. I call it five seconds. It's a moment of either transformation, meaning I'm telling you a story about how I once used to be one kind of person and now I'm a new kind of person. Or more common is realization. Which is I used to think something and then some stuff happened and now I think a new thing."

**Insight:** All effective stories are centered on a singular, brief moment of internal change or realization.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the 'five-second moment' where a transformation or realization occurs.
- Ensure 98% of the story provides the necessary context to make that moment clear.

*Timestamp: 00:05:28*

---

> "The dinner test is the idea that when you're telling a story in a formal way... the story that you're telling should be very closely related to the story you would tell someone if you were having dinner. So there should be no performance art included within your story."

**Insight:** Stories should feel natural and conversational, avoiding 'performance' tropes like unattributed dialogue or sound effects.

**Tactical advice:**
- Avoid opening with unattributed dialogue or sound effects (e.g., 'Bang!').
- Speak in a slightly elevated version of your natural dinner-table voice.

*Timestamp: 00:16:19*

---

> "I always say you should have, what I call an elephant at the beginning of the story... We have to immediately know that something is at stakes. We have to be worried about something."

**Insight:** Stories must establish stakes immediately to capture and hold audience attention.

**Tactical advice:**
- Plant an 'elephant' (a clear problem or goal) at the very beginning.
- Use a 'backpack'—tell the audience your plan so they can worry when it goes wrong.
- Use 'breadcrumbs' to drop hints about future developments.
- Use an 'hourglass' to slow down time during the most critical moments.
- Use a 'crystal ball' to predict a false or frightening future to increase tension.

*Timestamp: 00:25:43*

---

> "I just decided every day before I go to bed, I'm going to look back on the day and find one moment that would've been worth telling as a story. Even if it wasn't really worth telling, I was going to write it down. Now I don't write the whole thing down. That's crazy. It's not doable. What I do is I took an Excel spreadsheet, two columns, the date, and then I stretched the B column across."

**Insight:** The 'Homework for Life' practice builds a 'lens' for storytelling, allowing you to find meaningful moments in everyday life.

**Tactical advice:**
- Spend five minutes every night recording one story-worthy moment from the day.
- Use a simple spreadsheet with the date and a one-sentence description of the moment.
- Look for moments of emotional resonance, even if they seem small.

*Timestamp: 01:07:25*

---

> "Start every story you ever tell for the rest of your life with those two things. So you start with location, where are you? Location activates imagination... and you start with action, meaning something needs to be happening right away."

**Insight:** Opening with specific location and immediate action grounds the audience and signals that a narrative is beginning.

**Tactical advice:**
- Begin the story by stating exactly where you are.
- Ensure the first sentence involves an action to create momentum.

*Timestamp: 01:38:17*


## Merci Grace
*Merci Grace*

> "I think one of the things that is quite obvious from the get-go... is how different really great CEOs and startup leaders are at storytelling, at coming up with a pithy answer, at owning the room. The fundamentals of their businesses might not even look a lot better, but when you're in that room, you feel so differently about it."

**Insight:** Great leadership and fundraising are often driven more by the founder's ability to command a room and tell a story than by business fundamentals alone.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on owning the room and delivering pithy, memorable answers during pitches.

*Timestamp: 05:21*

---

> "Every pitch should start in the middle of the action, like a thriller or like a drama, like Mission Impossible movies always start with Tom cruise doing some crazy shit in the middle of the job right before the job that the actual movie is about because it gets your attention."

**Insight:** Hook your audience immediately by starting your narrative at the climax or the most exciting part of the business.

**Tactical advice:**
- Start your pitch or presentation in the middle of the action to capture immediate attention.
- Avoid starting with boring market slides; backfill context later.

*Timestamp: 07:25*

---

> "If you are going to say that you're the only founder that could start this company, or you have this really unique insight, start there. Even though it feels like you haven't built up to it yet, or anything like that, you don't have to, you'll backfill all of that later."

**Insight:** Lead with your most unique insight or competitive advantage to ensure investors don't tune out.

**Tactical advice:**
- Lead with your unique founder insight immediately in the deck.

*Timestamp: 08:21*


## Mike Maples Jr
*Mike Maples Jr*

> "The storytelling primitive ends up working spectacularly well for startups, right? We need to describe the world that is, we need to describe the world that could be... your job as the founder is to be Obi-Wan, not Luke."

**Insight:** In startup storytelling, the customer is the hero (Luke Skywalker) and the founder is the mentor (Obi-Wan) providing the tools to reach a better future.

**Tactical advice:**
- Describe the 'world that is' (the current pain/status quo)
- Describe the 'world that could be' (the transformed future)
- Position your product as the 'lightsaber' or tool the hero needs to succeed
- Toggle back and forth between the current state and the future state to create tension

*Timestamp: 01:16:04*

---

> "A movement is a way to crystallize the choice... The people who followed Martin Luther King bought into the aesthetically better future that his movement promised."

**Insight:** Storytelling should appeal to aesthetic and belief-based reasons for change, not just pragmatic ones.

**Tactical advice:**
- Leverage a grievance of a minority against the 'tyranny' of a majority
- Animate the story so early believers feel emotionally committed to moving to the new future

*Timestamp: 01:06:46*


## Nancy Duarte
*Nancy Duarte*

> "People had never seen someone tell a data story and stand in front of data and the scale in 90 foot screen... he would go city to city to city, because he was traveling for five years seeding, like planting seeds for a groundswell."

**Insight:** A powerful brand narrative is often built through a long-term 'groundswell' strategy rather than a single event.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use data storytelling to make abstract concepts (like climate change) tangible
- Seed a message through repeated, high-touch private presentations before a mass launch

*Timestamp: 00:05:40*


## Petra Wille
*Petra Wille*

> "First of all, people that's starting, often they are getting a better storytelling journey. Often totally underestimate how many time actually great storytellers are investing in creating the stories and making sure they can share the story in nice ways and formats. So that's maybe the first tip, you have to plan to put in a lot of work to create your story."

**Insight:** Effective storytelling requires significant time investment and iterative refinement rather than natural talent alone.

**Tactical advice:**
- Dedicate specific time (e.g., 1-2 hours daily for two weeks) to craft major strategy stories
- Use language that speaks to both hearts and minds
- Remove business lingo and three-letter abbreviations to avoid 'banner blindness'

*Timestamp: 00:36:18*

---

> "I use this hero's journey a lot where I think about, should I put the team in the heart of the story? Because if it's a story that should help me to motivate the team or to inspire the team to actions or something like that, then maybe it's nice if I put them in the center of the story and make them the heroes and talk about the demons and monsters they have to fight to once arrived at this brighter future."

**Insight:** Utilizing proven structures like the Hero's Journey helps make product visions more compelling and relatable.

**Tactical advice:**
- Cast the team or the user as the hero of the narrative
- Define the 'call to adventure' and the 'bright future' clearly
- Prepare the story in three lengths: 75 seconds, 6 minutes, and 18 minutes

*Timestamp: 00:48:17*


## Yuhki Yamashata
*Yuhki Yamashata*

> "I often talk about memification, which is this idea that I found this out most at Uber, I feel, where there's certain insights, data insights, research insights that were memmified to the point where someone like Travis or Dara would just cite this insight in the middle of a meeting, and you know that you've really done your job as, maybe, a researcher or a data scientist or product manager if people are able to do that and draw from that in that way."

**Insight:** Effective storytelling involves 'memifying' insights so they are easily remembered and cited by leadership to drive action.

**Tactical advice:**
- Synthesize disparate observations into a cohesive thesis
- Use real-world metaphors to explain complex concepts
- Aim for 'memification' where insights are catchy enough for execs to cite in meetings

*Timestamp: 00:15:21*


## Zoelle Egner
*Zoelle Egner*

> "The incredible power of a simple idea to bring people together. One of the reasons why VaccinateCA was so powerful and got so many people to help is everybody immediately understood why it would be useful and how they specifically could be making a difference... 'Pick up phone, help save lives.'"

**Insight:** A concise, mission-driven narrative gives people a sense of agency and attracts high-quality talent and volunteers.

**Tactical advice:**
- Distill the mission into a simple, actionable phrase
- Connect the individual's specific actions directly to the larger impact

*Timestamp: 00:11:31*

---

> "Having more of a point of view than just about your product, you can try and say, like, 'We are part of something bigger. Here's the broader circle or movement that we are a part of.' It makes it feel more inevitable and more like you're not just self servingly talking about your tiny corner of the world."

**Insight:** Positioning a startup as part of a larger inevitable movement increases perceived sophistication and importance.

**Tactical advice:**
- Develop a point of view that extends beyond the product's features
- Connect the company's mission to broader industry or societal trends

*Timestamp: 00:30:45*


## Josh Miller
*Josh Miller*

> "the storytelling team is about people we don't have the privilege of serving yet... That could be an investor, air quote, 'investor relations.' That could be members of the press, air quote, 'PR.' That could be just people out in the world, air quote, 'marketing'... It's telling our story to people and thinking about that holistically in full stack."

**Insight:** Storytelling should be a unified discipline that covers marketing, PR, and IR to ensure a consistent narrative across all external audiences.

**Tactical advice:**
- Hire multidisciplinary storytellers (e.g., former reporters, filmmakers) rather than traditional marketers
- Focus on 'radical trust building' by showing the human side of the company

*Timestamp: 00:48:07*


## Krithika Shankarraman
*Krithika Shankarraman*

> "A brand is an expectation that you create within your audience."

**Insight:** Brand is the delta between expectations and reality.

**Tactical advice:**
