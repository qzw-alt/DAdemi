> "For getting awareness, we've mainly been posting what we've shipped on social media, that's how people know about us."

**Insight:** High-quality product demos and 'building in public' on social media can drive massive organic growth.

**Tactical advice:**
- Share visual demos of what you ship on social media
- Leverage organic word-of-mouth through public updates

> "For early stage startups, we're almost always running the launch announcement as an exclusive, which means you give the news to a single outlet. And they're the only ones who get to write about it."

**Insight:** Modern PR for startups often requires offering an exclusive to a single outlet rather than a broad embargoed release.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify a single target outlet that covers companies at your specific stage
- Prepare the website for traffic before the launch announcement

*Timestamp: 01:11:19*

> "Don't do a straight funding announcement. A lot of founders raise money and they're like, cool, let's announce. It's like, no, we'll use that funding announcement as a news hook to tell a larger story and a larger story might be your products available. You have reference customers, you have momentum."

**Insight:** Funding is a news hook, not the story itself; it should be used to highlight product availability or customer momentum.

**Tactical advice:**
- Combine funding news with a product launch or partnership announcement
- Focus on making the story interesting to the outlet's readers, not just the company

*Timestamp: 01:12:08*

> "Don't sleep on local press. If you have a local business or a local story or local customers... We turned all of our customers into heroes and went after local press."

**Insight:** Local press can be more accessible and effective for startups with regional impact or physical customers.

**Tactical advice:**
- Pitch local outlets by highlighting how the business helps local heroes or customers
- Tie the company story to local trends like hiring or economic shifts

> "I'm a big believer in comms. ... I think that there are very few and far between incredible megaphones for what it is that you or your company is doing where you get to reach such a breadth of people with that stamp of credibility and notice. How do you get somebody to say, 'Hey, this is really something you should pay attention to.'?"

**Insight:** Traditional PR and comms provide a 'stamp of credibility' and a broad reach that owned media often cannot replicate.

**Tactical advice:**
- Maintain straightforward, accessible relationships with the press
- Leverage credible journalists to provide a third-party endorsement of your product's value

## Bret Taylor
*Bret Taylor*

> "With satellite imagery, it honestly wasn't the most important part of Google Maps, but it was the sizzle to the steak and it created... a viral moment."

**Insight:** A successful launch often requires a 'sizzle' feature—something visually impressive or viral—to draw people into the core utility.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify a 'sizzle' feature that generates buzz even if it isn't the primary use case

*Timestamp: 00:10:35*

---

> "Biz [Stone] was really focused on getting celebrities and public figures onto Twitter... we were exclusively focused on polishing the product... we totally lost for no reason related to product at all."

**Insight:** Distribution and strategic partnerships (like celebrity adoption) can beat a technically superior product.

**Tactical advice:**
- Prioritize distribution and 'people worth following' over pure product polish in social/networked products

*Timestamp: 00:25:31*

---

> "I think because product-led growth became very popular... if PLG means that you aren't actually engaging with the buyer of your software, you're not going to grow."

**Insight:** GTM strategy must match the buyer persona; PLG fails when the user and the buyer are different people.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use direct sales when the buyer (e.g., Finance) is different from the user (e.g., Employee)
- Use developer-led GTM for platform products where engineers have purchasing latitude

> "There's the knowing something's coming and then there's the knowing what to do with it. You can use just some status keeping thing to say, 'This is coming in Q4'... but it's what to do with it and how to position it and how to talk about it and all the things that was missing from it."

**Insight:** Successful product launches require 'readiness'—ensuring internal teams know how to talk about and support a feature, not just when it's shipping.

**Tactical advice:**
- Move beyond simple status updates to provide 'readiness' guidance for internal teams
- Ensure every major launch includes specific instructions on how to position the new value to customers

*Timestamp: 00:38:42*

---

> "Treating content is a part of the development lifecycle process. You really want to treat it as a part of definition of done. When you think about product-led growth... it's all about creating that experience and keeps people in and helps them upgrade."

**Insight:** In-product education and content should be considered a core part of the 'definition of done' for any feature release.

**Tactical advice:**
- Include the creation of in-app guides or educational content in the feature development checklist
- Work with product marketing to develop playbooks for driving engagement through in-app content

*Timestamp: 00:22:15*


## Chris Hutchins
*Chris Hutchins*

> "launching with two or three episodes, either all at once or in a week is a really valuable strategy... the ranking charts are all driven by different variables than you would imagine. They're driven a lot by momentum of new subscribers."

**Insight:** Launch success is often driven by concentrated momentum that triggers platform algorithms rather than total volume.

**Tactical advice:**
- Launch with multiple pieces of content simultaneously to build early momentum
- Focus on driving a high volume of new subscribers in a short window to spike rankings

*Timestamp: 00:30:47*


## Christopher Lochhead
*Christopher Lochhead*

> "What if you did that as a software company? What if you launched a thing... the way Hollywood launches a movie? ... the idea of a lightning strike is, if you are in our target audience for that day or that two days, we are going to be all over you. ... I'd rather matter for one week a year than be irrelevant for the rest of the year."

**Insight:** Concentrated 'lightning strikes' are more effective than 'peanut butter' marketing that spreads budget thinly over time.

**Tactical advice:**
- Execute 1-2 massive 'lightning strike' events per year to create undeniable presence.
- Focus all marketing efforts on being unavoidable to your target audience for a short window.

*Timestamp: 01:27:07*


## Claire Butler
*Claire Butler*

> "The way I think about it now is this bottoms-up motion, that really is focused on ICs... they love you so much that they're willing to put their social capital and themselves in the line and spread the product throughout whatever their communities are. And the one that's connected the most to revenue is companies."

**Insight:** A successful bottom-up GTM strategy relies on winning the trust of individual contributors who then act as internal champions within their organizations.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus initial adoption efforts on practitioners (ICs) rather than executive buyers
- Enable users to leverage their social capital to spread the product internally

*Timestamp: 00:14:17*

> "We wanted to see was that designers were excited when they saw the tool... I remember they would take the laptop out of Dylan's hands when he would start showing it because they wanted to play with it. And to me, when I started seeing designers do that... that kind of emotion, no reaction of wanting to play with it in these demos was really what gave me confidence that we were ready to launch."

**Insight:** Visceral user excitement and the desire to 'play' with the product are stronger indicators of launch readiness than a complete feature set.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look for 'pull' signals where users physically want to interact with the product during demos
- Launch when you have enough features to sustain full-time use for at least a small group

*Timestamp: 00:21:47*


## Dr. Fei Fei Li
*Dr. Fei Fei Li*

> "We're already seeing some really exciting use cases, virtual production for movies... robotic simulation... a psychologist team called us to use Marble to do psychology research. It turned out some of the psychiatric patients they study, they need to understand how their brain respond to different immersive things... Marble is a really almost instantaneous way of getting so many of these experimental environments into their hands."

**Insight:** Early product launches for horizontal AI technologies should focus on discovering unexpected high-value use cases through user experimentation.

**Tactical advice:**
- Release early versions to see how different industries (VFX, healthcare, gaming) adapt the tool.
- Look for 'delightful' features (like visualization dots) that help users understand and connect with the technology.

*Timestamp: 00:52:59*


## Emilie Gerber
*Emilie Gerber*

> "When we pitch a funding story, we make it very clear, 'Hey, we're reaching out with a startup launch or funding. We're offering this to you as an exclusive, meaning we're not going to pitch anyone else if you take the story. Here's the amount that's raised, here's the space that... Here's the space they're in and here are the investors.'"

**Insight:** Funding announcements should be pitched as exclusives with clear, high-level details rather than convoluted narratives.

**Tactical advice:**
- Offer the story as an exclusive to one reporter at a time
- Include the amount raised, the industry space, and the lead investors in the initial pitch

*Timestamp: 00:15:10*

---

> "I highly recommend not having a firm date that you think you need to announce something and going instead with when a reporter is able to cover your story... if you can optimize for the reporter over the timing, you're going to see such a better outcome."

**Insight:** Flexibility on launch dates is crucial to securing high-quality press coverage.

**Tactical advice:**
- Prioritize reporter availability over internal launch deadlines
- Avoid issuing press releases on a rigid date if no coverage is secured

*Timestamp: 01:23:12*

---

> "I would say before an announcement happens, you probably want to kick off six weeks in advance. So when we start with the company, it's like we're working on the blog, we're doing a media training, we're doing the media outreach, we're getting quotes from investors."

**Insight:** A successful press launch requires approximately six weeks of lead time for preparation and outreach.

**Tactical advice:**
- Start PR prep 6 weeks before the target announcement date
- Coordinate investor quotes and media training early in the process

*Timestamp: 01:22:27*


## Emily Kramer
*Emily Kramer*

> "This is a marketing brief that I recommend you do before you make anything big in marketing or do any big projects. And it's just what are the goals? What's the audience? What's the creative or unique end goal? What's this thing? I guess what's going to make it different and stand out from other companies? The second C is the channels or how this is going to be distributed. How are you going to get the word out about this? Deep thinking there. And then the last few are the stakeholders."

**Insight:** The GACCS framework (Goals, Audience, Creative, Channels, Stakeholders) ensures strategic alignment before executing any major marketing project.

**Tactical advice:**
- Complete a GACCS brief for every major launch or campaign.
- Share the brief with product stakeholders early to get buy-in on messaging and distribution channels.

*Timestamp: 00:44:17*


## Geoffrey Moore
*Geoffrey Moore*

> "The Crossing the Chasm model is, 'Can you create a viable repeatable business?' And in order to do that, you need to have an ecosystem of partners work with you in order to consolidate your position. Well, why would an ecosystem work with some startup that nobody's ever heard of? The answer would be if you had consolidated a market segment where you were number one."

**Insight:** GTM success depends on becoming a market leader in a small segment to attract the ecosystem partners necessary for scaling.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on a single beachhead segment to become the 'big fish' that partners want to support.
- Prioritize market share in a niche over broad, shallow adoption.

*Timestamp: 00:07:23*

---

> "In the early market, you know you're there because first of all, the story is the technology... In the bowling alley one then the playbook is, 'No, where's the problem?'... In the tornado... this is when you do want sales coverage, and you do want to go broad."

**Insight:** Go-to-market playbooks must shift from technology-centric to problem-centric to market-share-centric as the category matures.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use a 'project model' for visionaries and a 'solution model' for pragmatists.
- Shift to horizontal sales coverage only once the market enters the 'tornado' phase.

*Timestamp: 00:44:08*

> "We found that just translating it with AI was able to get performance almost as good as the original, in the original language. So this is going to fly to the entire market."

**Insight:** AI-driven localization and creative generation allow for rapid, high-performance global product launches.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use AI to localize ad creative into multiple languages for global GTM without rebuilding from scratch.
- Iterate on dozens of AI-generated ad variations to find the highest-performing creative through performance channels.
- Monitor user comments on AI ads to gauge when the technology has reached 'believability' thresholds for the general public.

## Janna Bastow
*Janna Bastow*

> "But one of the other things that you can be doing for your marketing and sales teams is separating your hard launch from your soft launch. So what you should be doing is basically saying your developers are able to launch something on a particular date and it's the date that's convenient for them... When this new thing comes out, that's a soft launch. As soon as that soft launch is out, great, let's kick off this launch meeting with launch steps."

**Insight:** Decoupling the technical release (soft launch) from the marketing event (hard launch) reduces stress and improves marketing quality.

**Tactical advice:**
- Perform a soft launch first to gather functional videos and testimonials from early users
- Use the period between soft and hard launch to plan a high-impact marketing campaign based on the final product

## Jason Feifer
*Jason Feifer*

> "Sometimes the point of it is not to reach the people who are reading it at all... Maybe what it really is is to tweet it and then put some money behind promoting that tweet because then you can target that you got coverage to the people who you want to notice you got coverage. And I see a lot of people do that. They'll take articles that we ran on Entrepreneur and they'll basically turn them into advertisements."

**Insight:** Press coverage is often more valuable as a 'social proof' asset for marketing campaigns than as a direct source of traffic.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use 'As seen in' logos on your website to build immediate social cachet and validation.
- Put marketing spend behind social media posts featuring your press coverage to ensure it reaches your specific target audience.

*Timestamp: 00:38:48*


## Karri Saarinen
*Karri Saarinen*

> "We were in this private beta stage for almost a year... We invited people based on... We invited more smaller companies using the tools we currently supported. And then also I was trying to see who is more interested versus just, I don't know, I just want to try it out type of people."

**Insight:** A long private beta with selective onboarding allows for iterative bug fixing and ensures the product works for a specific segment before scaling.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use a waitlist survey to filter for high-intent users in your target segment.
- Onboard users in small cohorts to avoid being overwhelmed by duplicate feedback on the same bugs.

*Timestamp: 01:10:23*

> "With our announcement, we wrote it more direct or authentic to us like, 'This is what we're going to do and this is why, and these are some of the things we're going to do.' On a Twitter, we did the same thing. All of us founders, we wrote our own reasons why we're doing this, and I think it was just much more... I think people like us could resonate more with it."

**Insight:** Authentic, founder-led announcements resonate more with early adopters than polished corporate marketing.

**Tactical advice:**
- Have each founder share their personal 'why' for building the company during the launch.
- Target the initial announcement at the specific community where your early adopters spend time (e.g., Twitter/X).

*Timestamp: 01:23:17*


## Kevin Weil
*Kevin Weil*

> "We tried to get it all at once. It was a new blockchain. It was a basket of currencies originally. It was integration into WhatsApp and Messenger... I think the whole world kind of went like, 'Oh my God, that's a lot of change at once.' ... introduced the change a little bit more gently, maybe still gotten to that same outcome, but fewer new things at once."

**Insight:** Launching too many radical innovations simultaneously can trigger massive resistance; incremental introduction of change is often more effective.

**Tactical advice:**
- Avoid launching multiple 'new-to-the-world' concepts in a single release
- Introduce changes one at a time to build user and regulator trust

*Timestamp: 01:18:26*


## Lulu Cheng Meservey
*Lulu Cheng Meservey*

> "If you want to spread something you go out in concentric circles starting from your own desk. So you need to get first really clear with yourself about what your message is and just get really crisp with it... And then the next circle is going to be your co-founders, your executives, your employees, your investors, you go to your power users, and you go out from there, and it has to be in that sequence."

**Insight:** Successful message distribution follows a strict sequence of concentric circles to ensure internal alignment before external reach.

**Tactical advice:**
- List and rank target audiences (limit to 5-6) by their ability to influence success.
- Map where each audience 'resides intellectually' (podcasts, subreddits, newsletters).
- Ensure the inner circle (employees) is fully aligned before moving to the next circle to maintain credibility.

*Timestamp: 00:19:15*

> "Give it away for free to the right people. If you can choose the people who are going to love it, look at the Venn diagram of people who are going to be obsessed with this product. And people who have a large following among the other people that you want to get to, whoever falls into that sliver of the Venn diagram shower them with free product."

**Insight:** Targeted product seeding should focus on the intersection of high product affinity and high audience influence.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify influencers who fall into the intersection of 'obsessed with the product' and 'followed by the target audience'.
- Shower this specific 'sliver' of the Venn diagram with free product to generate organic evangelism.

*Timestamp: 01:01:37*


## Marc Benioff
*Marc Benioff*

> "I'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy."

**Insight:** Successful launches often involve high-volume experimentation to identify a single breakthrough tactic that can be scaled into a broader strategy.

**Tactical advice:**
- Test multiple marketing tactics simultaneously
- Identify which specific action 'sticks' or goes viral
- Double down on the winning tactic to form your core strategy

*Timestamp: 00:09*

> "We hired a bunch of actors. They were doing this event in San Francisco... we got some picket signs at Home Depot and made some signs that said, 'The end of software is near,'... We were running a protest outside of Siebel... we hit a button, and we have other actors in a van who come out, and they are staging themselves as news crew. So they are like KNMS, K No More Software, and we're like... They're interviewing the protesters."

**Insight:** Guerilla marketing and theatrical stunts can create a 'remarkable' moment that breaks through the noise of a crowded market.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use 'protest' or counter-narrative messaging to differentiate from incumbents
- Create staged media moments to increase the perceived scale of a movement
- Focus on being 'remarkable' so people have something to talk about

*Timestamp: 16:50*

---

> "I have Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson who are two friends of mine helping me. So they said, 'We'll cut ads for you.'... I'm running aggressive marketing against Microsoft because they have really a terrible product, Copilot, that I have to position against and market against."

**Insight:** Modern launch marketing requires a mix of high-profile creative content and aggressive competitive positioning.

**Tactical advice:**
- Leverage celebrity partnerships for high-visibility ad campaigns
- Directly name and position against competitors' weaknesses
- Use social media (e.g., Twitter) to gather immediate feedback on ad concepts

*Timestamp: 20:04*


## Melissa Perri + Denise Tilles
*Melissa Perri + Denise Tilles*

> "Product ops will take on a lot of the coordination of those types of things... making sure that go-to-market process is consistent across the organization so that it's not like... everybody's reinventing the wheel and somebody on a go-to-market team has to figure out how to go-to-market differently with a different product team."

**Insight:** Standardizing the go-to-market (GTM) process ensures consistency and efficiency across multiple product launches.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create standardized GTM templates for product managers to fill out
- Establish a consistent cadence for cross-functional GTM reviews

*Timestamp: 00:28:21*


## Mihika Kapoor
*Mihika Kapoor*

> "I think that hype as well is really tied to emotion. So to the extent that a person using a product can feel like, 'Oh, this thing that is built in the product was built for me not to advance the company's goals or anything like that, but to make me feel special, to make me feel happy.'"

**Insight:** Effective product hype is rooted in emotional connection and making the user feel that a feature was built specifically for their delight.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use Easter egg hunts or 'birthday presents' in-product to drive engagement during milestones
- Align hype strategies with the specific brand personality of the product (e.g., 'cheeky' for FigJam)
- Leverage internal company forums like Sales Kickoffs to build momentum before external launches

*Timestamp: 00:41:34*


## Nan Yu
*Nan Yu*

> "With marketing and communication with customers, you basically have a limited amount of opportunities to do so... If you miss one of those opportunities, you don't get it back again. You can't time travel back and say like, 'Okay, actually, let's redo first quarter and say this message that we wish we could have gotten into the field.'"

**Insight:** Marketing launches are finite opportunities in time that cannot be recovered if missed.

**Tactical advice:**
- Respect the rhythm of the calendar (weeks, months, quarters) for major communications.
- Treat launch dates as critical windows for reaching your audience.

*Timestamp: 01:11:39*


## Nikita Bier
*Nikita Bier*

> "I think a lot of founders separate marketing and product growth... but they're both the same. They both should be treated as the same. If you're targeting a community... you need to build marketing that shows imagery of that community... then when you get in the app, you have to be able to join that community."

**Insight:** Successful launches require perfect alignment between the external marketing message and the internal product experience.

**Tactical advice:**
- Align ad creative imagery with the specific communities users will find inside the app
- Ensure the invitation and onboarding flow mentions the specific community the user is joining

*Timestamp: 01:33:03*


## Ray Cao
*Ray Cao*

> "I would say at least 10 different ad creatives will be ideal per week and the more the better."

**Insight:** High-velocity creative testing is essential for success on content-graph-based platforms.

**Tactical advice:**
- Aim to test at least 10 new creatives per week to find what resonates.
- Use tools like CapCut to generate high volumes of content quickly.

*Timestamp: 01:07:27*

---

> "A broader targeting approach is actually recommended at the very early stage... I can see for the first two years in the business... they want to do a very small niche targeting on the platform because you're limiting yourself."

**Insight:** Start with broad targeting to allow the algorithm to discover your audience rather than over-constraining it with niche parameters.

**Tactical advice:**
- Avoid niche targeting or heavy remarketing in the first month of a campaign.
- Allow at least one month for the platform to 'learn' and optimize.

*Timestamp: 01:08:53*


## Ryan Hoover
*Ryan Hoover*

> "Launch sometimes doesn't help with that, but there are many other reasons why you might wanna launch. So, customer acquisition one, to get the word out. Another can be recruiting. So, by, you know, sharing your story, getting people excited, it might make it easier to recruit and get people excited about, you know, what you're building. Another is fundraising. Sometimes it can create momentum, you know, as- as other investors, they do read the news and they know that, you know, when this company is more public, they're might be more heat around it- a particular deal. Feedback is one. Um, the feedback from users, feedback just serendipitously and- and sort of another one is partnership."

**Insight:** Product launches serve multiple strategic goals beyond just customer acquisition, including recruiting, fundraising, and team morale.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use launches to build recruiting momentum and excitement for potential hires.
- Leverage the public nature of a launch to create 'heat' for fundraising rounds.
- View launches as a team-building moment to celebrate accomplishments and boost morale.

*Timestamp: 00:22:07*

> "Some of the things that I've noticed that make a big difference is we've already talked about the tagline copy, that goes to, not only the post, but also the maker. Usually people tend to add like some introduction, some context. Uh, generally a lot of people will, they- they manufacture PR speak there too, and so speaking like a human, I think, is important. Also keeping it a little brief... another big one is the gallery is- is often the first thing that someone is gonna see once they land on the page. And so, just naturally our eyes gravitate towards visuals. And some of the most interesting presentations I've seen is people use the gallery almost like a slideshow, um, like telling a story, where each slide is- is communicating like a different- well, a story of some sort."

**Insight:** Effective Product Hunt launches rely on human-centric copy and visual storytelling through the gallery.

**Tactical advice:**
- Write the introduction and tagline as a human, not a PR professional.
- Keep the maker's introduction brief to respect the user's time.
- Use the image gallery as a narrative slideshow to show 'before and after' or product evolution.

*Timestamp: 00:26:44*


## Zoelle Egner
*Zoelle Egner*

> "PR is not going to get you leads or users... What it is good for is credibility... hiring or maybe improving the response rate for your cold outbound. Those are the two that I think make the most sense, because in both cases they have a different distribution mechanism."

**Insight:** PR should be viewed as a credibility asset for proactive outreach rather than a passive lead generation tool.

**Tactical advice:**
- Include PR coverage in recruiting emails to increase candidate interest
- Use press mentions in cold sales outbound to establish trust
- Don't rely on PR for direct user acquisition

*Timestamp: 01:01:56*

---

> "Instead you can have not just one big launch but a series of launches that allow you to stay top of mind, to create momentum with your users, and to show up in lots of different places because audiences respond to novelty."

**Insight:** A cadence of smaller launches is more effective for maintaining momentum than a single 'big bang' launch.

**Tactical advice:**
- Plan a series of launches every few months to stay top of mind
- Use novelty to re-engage existing communities
- Focus on momentum rather than just one-time press coverage

*Timestamp: 01:04:03*
