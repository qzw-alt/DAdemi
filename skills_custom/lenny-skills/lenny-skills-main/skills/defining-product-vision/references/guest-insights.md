> "At the most basic level, I would say that our product is our journalism, which we then marry with a really compelling and useful user experience, in a way that helps people really act on our journalism so that they can understand and engage with the world around them."

**Insight:** Product vision in media should center on the core content (journalism) enhanced by a user experience that drives real-world engagement.

**Tactical advice:**
- Marry core content with compelling UX
- Focus on helping users 'act' on the information provided

> "We have the solar system metaphor where for us news is the sun in the sense that it's why we exist. It is what gives us our brand heritage and reputation. It's what instills trust. It's also where we just have the largest audience when you think about a funnel for our portfolio, and it's also where we just have the most amount of high quality coverage. But then that sun helps you give birth to other satellite planets or products that have a lot of the same DNA."

**Insight:** Use a 'solar system' model to define a product portfolio where a core 'sun' product provides the brand equity and audience for satellite products.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the 'sun' product that drives brand heritage and trust
- Build satellite products that share the core DNA of the primary product
- Use the primary product as the top-of-funnel for the rest of the portfolio

> "One thing that's really interesting is that our impact and our business goals are in service of our mission, which is to seek the truth and help people understand the world, not the other way around. What it means is that the way that we think about impact is growing a giant subscription business. That business exists to strengthen an informed democracy."

**Insight:** Align business goals (like subscriptions) as a means to fund and achieve a broader societal mission.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define business metrics as being 'in service' of the mission
- Measure impact not just by revenue, but by mission-driven outcomes like policy changes

*Alisa Cohn*

> "Vision of the company. So when this company is successful, what does that look like?... What that might look like is a big venture outcome that we all read about. And if you are both assuming that you both think the same thing but aren't talking about it explicitly... then what often happens if you have differences is they come home to roost."

**Insight:** Founders and leaders must explicitly align on what 'success' looks like to avoid fundamental strategic drift.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ask: 'What is the vision for the company when it reaches its full potential?'
- Discuss the trade-offs inherent in different visions (e.g., lifestyle business vs. venture scale)

## Alex Komoroske
*Alex Komoroske*

> "You need coherence about where you're going and the way you get that is by creating a North Star for yourself. It should be in three to five years in the future, it should be very low resolution. It should describe a thing that every single person who reads it who has any kind of knowledge that might be useful or relevant agrees that it is plausible."

**Insight:** A North Star should be a low-resolution, highly plausible future state that provides coherence without over-prescribing the path.

**Tactical advice:**
- Set a 3-5 year vision that is 'low resolution' to allow for adaptation.
- Ensure the vision is plausible enough that experts across functions (legal, eng, etc.) can see how it could work.

## Ami Vora
*Ami Vora*

> "If we all agree that the feeling of something should be, I'm sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday, then people will just naturally build something that feels more consistent. You know what the iconography, the designers know what iconography should look like. You know what the communication and join pattern should look like."

**Insight:** Use emotional metaphors to create a shared vision that guides decentralized design and product decisions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define the 'feeling' of the product using a relatable real-world analogy (e.g., 'sitting in a park' or 'face-to-face communication').
- Use these metaphors to ensure consistency across different teams without micromanaging every detail.

*Timestamp: 00:30:55*

> "For strategy to be useful, it actually has to change our behavior as a team to create better customer outcomes... What's the change, or coming out with a strategy that'll align people because we have the story, we have the narrative, we have the sequence."

**Insight:** A vision or strategy is only successful if it results in a tangible change in team prioritization or product behavior.

**Tactical advice:**
- Evaluate strategy by asking: 'What will we do differently tomorrow because of this?'
- Use narrative and sequence to align the team on the long-term path.

*Timestamp: 00:44:08*


## Andy Raskin
*Andy Raskin_*

> "The one thing I say is it's this one story that the CEO uses to drive success in marketing, sales, but also product. That it becomes like a north star, strategic north star for product roadmap, for fundraising, for recruiting, really everything."

**Insight:** A strategic narrative serves as the foundational vision that aligns all company functions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ensure the product vision is embedded within a larger narrative about market change.

*Timestamp: 00:08:19*


## Annie Pearl
*Annie Pearl*

> "Strategy is really just an integrated set of choices that outline how you're going to win in whatever marketplace you choose. And so, a good product strategy is going to answer questions like what's your winning aspiration? But maybe more importantly, where are you going to play? What are the markets you're going to go after? What are the segments of those markets? What are the personas in the segments of those markets? And then, how are you going to win with a target audience?"

**Insight:** Product strategy is an integrated set of choices defining the target market, segments, and personas to determine how the company will win.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define the 'winning aspiration' first.
- Identify specific markets, segments, and personas to target.
- Articulate exactly how you will win with that target audience.

*Timestamp: 00:00:00*


## Anneka Gupta
*Anneka Gupta*

> "When people say, "I want someone that's strategic," what they're really saying is, "I want someone that can come up with and articulate a compelling and simple why behind the decisions and the direction of the company and product.""

**Insight:** Strategic leadership is defined by the ability to articulate a simple, compelling 'why' and the willingness to champion difficult long-term changes.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on articulating a simple and compelling 'why' behind every major product decision.
- Act as a change agent for initiatives that are best for the long-term interest of the company, even if they are hard to execute.

*Timestamp: 00:00:00*


## April Dunford
*April Dunford 2.0*

> "The easiest way to take over a great big market is to define a segment of the market that is underserved by the market leader... knocking over that pin enables us to get to the three pins right beside it. And so now I'm established here as a beachhead and I can go get the next three pins."

**Insight:** A 'bowling pin' strategy—dominating a specific niche before expanding—is often more effective for long-term growth than attempting to create a new category from scratch.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify a 'lead pin' segment that is underserved by the current market leader.
- Focus all resources on dominating that specific niche beachhead.
- Sequence expansion into adjacent segments once the initial niche is secured.

*Timestamp: 00:53:59*


## Aparna Chennapragada
*Aparna Chennapragada*

> "You do want to look for at least two out of these three factors, inflection points here if you want to make a really good product. Number one is there a... Shift is a step function in the tech... The second factor that we should look for is, what is the consumer behavior shift?... And I'd say the third inflection point, particularly I would say in enterprise but also in consumer, is the business model shift."

**Insight:** A strong product vision for a new category should be anchored in at least two of three inflection points: technology shifts, consumer behavior shifts, or business model shifts.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify step-functions in technology (like LLMs or mobile) that enable new solutions
- Look for changes in how consumers use existing tools (like using a camera as a keyboard)
- Evaluate if a new business model (like outcome-based monetization) is possible

*Timestamp: 00:41:33*


## Ayo Omojola
*Ayo Omojola*

> "Cash App, as a team we really cared about what we could do that was different and better than what else existed in-market. Being different is not enough... Being better is not enough... It has to be better than what exists today in a way that matters to the end user"

**Insight:** Product vision must focus on differentiation that provides a tangible, superior benefit to the user rather than just being different for its own sake.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify what exists in the market and intentionally build something else.
- Ensure the improvement is meaningful to the end user's experience.
- Avoid just making a 'better' version that costs more without unique value.

*Timestamp: 00:00*


## Archie Abrams
*Archie Abrams*

> "The technical architecture determines strategy in a technology company even more than the what and who we're building for. If you build the right technical how and set yourself up to have a platform that can be adaptable, flexible, that is incredibly valuable over the long term."

**Insight:** Technical architecture is a primary driver of long-term strategy; the 'how' is as important as the 'what' for maintaining future optionality.

**Tactical advice:**
- Evaluate product roadmaps based on whether the technical foundation allows for future adaptability.
- Involve senior leadership in deep technical reviews to ensure architecture aligns with a 100-year vision.

*Timestamp: 00:44:35*


## Ben Williams
*Ben Williams*

> "The vision is the nirvana state that you aim to enable for your users and customers in five to 10 years... It should be bound to your target market. So not too wide and not too narrow. And critically it should not mention your company, your product, or anything solution related at all."

**Insight:** A strong product vision describes a future state for the user that is entirely agnostic of the specific solution or company.

**Tactical advice:**
- Prefix vision statements with 'In the future...' to ensure a long-term focus
- Ensure the vision does not mention the product or company name

*Timestamp: 00:51:31*


## Benjamin Mann
*Benjamin Mann*

> "The second one is Good Strategy Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt. Just thinking about in a very clear way, how do you build product? It's one of the best strategy books I've read and strategy is a hard word to even think about in many ways."

**Insight:** Effective product vision is built on a clear diagnosis of the challenge and a coherent guiding policy, rather than just ambitious goals.

**Tactical advice:**
- Differentiate between 'good strategy' (diagnosis and action) and 'bad strategy' (fluff and goals)
- Study the 'Alignment Problem' to understand the long-term stakes of the product's impact on society

*Timestamp: 01:10:20*


## Ben Horowitz
*Ben Horowitz*

> "You're just the keeper of the vision... somebody who's got to consolidate, get all the good ideas, prioritize them, decide which good ideas we're going to do"

**Insight:** The vision-holder's role is to synthesize and prioritize the best ideas from across the organization.

**Tactical advice:**
- Work backwards from the goal of a product that 'works' and customers love
- Maintain the vision as a filter for which 'good ideas' to actually execute

*Timestamp: 00:49:22*


## Bob Baxley
*Bob Baxley*

> "Disneyland, still the best vision statement of all time, which is the happiest place on earth. So once you tell an employee this is supposed to be the happiest place on earth, then you're signaling all sorts of things about how they need to pick up the trash and how they need to show up on time and how they need to wear their uniform."

**Insight:** A powerful vision statement acts as a behavioral signal that guides every employee's micro-decisions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a vision that is 'always over the horizon' to provide a permanent organizing principle for growth and acquisitions.

*Timestamp: 01:03:33*


## Benjamin Lauzier
*Benjamin Lauzier*

> "Lyft's vision was always anchored around transportation, people of transportation... Uber had... this notion of being a logistics platform for assets in the world, for transporting people, for transporting things... I think Uber was able to rebound much more quickly because of how diversified the business was."

**Insight:** A product vision that is too narrow (transporting people vs. logistics) can create existential risk during market shifts like COVID-19.

**Tactical advice:**
- Evaluate if your vision is anchored to a specific use case or a broader capability (e.g., 'moving people' vs. 'logistics').
- Consider how a more diversified vision allows for pivoting into adjacent categories (like food delivery) during crises.

*Timestamp: 00:55:15*


## Brandon Chu
*Brandon Chu*

> "put forward a vision for what that team's going to accomplish that year, whether that is a directional change or even specific outcomes in some cases. And we spend time aligning with both Tobi, the rest of the C level exec team, even sometimes the board on what that is"

**Insight:** Annual planning should focus on high-level directional vision and outcomes rather than granular feature roadmaps.

**Tactical advice:**
- Align the executive team and board on broad directional changes annually
- Set a 'North Star' that allows for chaotic iteration underneath it

*Timestamp: 13:15*


## Cam Adams
*Cam Adams*

> "At Canva, we're all about visual communications... one of the things that's very particular about Canva is really setting visions. And I'm in visions, not just in the sense of looking forward two, three years, but also visions in the very visual sense. We need to be able to see it. We need mock-ups. We need prototypes. You need to get that idea out of your head and present it to someone in a visual form that helps you talk about and communicate about it."

**Insight:** Product vision should be communicated visually through prototypes and mock-ups rather than just abstract documents.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use visual artifacts like pitch decks and prototypes to align the team on future direction
- Ensure the vision is tangible enough that stakeholders can 'see' the end state

*Timestamp: 00:14:12*


## Brian Chesky
*Brian Chesky*

> "The exercise isn't necessarily to say if people say they want to hit a goal, I say, okay, I added a zero, you have to hit that goal. It's more the exercise of what would it take to be 10X bigger or do something 10 times better? Because what you find is when you push people, they will sometimes think about the problem differently."

**Insight:** Use '10X' or 'add a zero' thinking to force teams to abandon incrementalism and find first-principles solutions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ask 'What would it take to 10X this?' to break current processes
- Use ambitious scale as a tool for first-principles thinking

*Timestamp: 00:46:32*


## Bret Taylor
*Bret Taylor*

> "What if we inverted the hierarchy here and made the map the canvas?"

**Insight:** Breakthrough product visions often come from flipping the traditional hierarchy of information.

**Tactical advice:**
- Experiment with 'inverting the hierarchy' of your product's UI to find a more compelling canvas

*Timestamp: 00:08:49*


## Casey Winters
*Casey Winters*

> "The challenge you practically deal with as a product leader is you end up recruiting, and managing, and growing a lot of executional people who can get stuff done, but if they want to get to the director level or if they want to get to my level, they need to get more strategic."

**Insight:** The primary bottleneck for career advancement from senior PM to leadership is the transition from execution-focused work to independent strategic thinking.

**Tactical advice:**
- Practice writing comprehensive strategy documents without heavy guidance from leadership
- Study industry changes and competitor features to build a 'strategic' muscle

*Timestamp: 44:06*


## Chandra Janakiraman
*Chandra Janakiraman*

> "Product strategy sits between the mission and vision and the plan... It forces choice to deploy scarce resources to generate maximum impact."

**Insight:** Strategy acts as the connective tissue between high-level purpose and tactical execution by mandating specific choices.

**Tactical advice:**
- Position strategy between the mission/vision and the roadmap
- Focus on achieving 'resonance' between the product and the market

*Timestamp: 00:12:49*

---

> "What does the product look like in five to 10 years? Why is the world better in 10 years? And what is the most exciting version of that view?"

**Insight:** Big-S strategy requires a 'future-backward' approach that focuses on aspirational impact rather than just solving current problems.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ask leaders to describe a 'day in the life' of a user 5-10 years in the future
- Cluster long-term ideas into three distinct, cohesive versions of the future
- Create 'concept cars' or prototypes to inspire the team without the intent of immediate commercialization

*Timestamp: 01:17:41*

---

> "I want you to imagine the progress on all these strategic pillars and what the headline of that newspaper article looks like. It's called a newspaper headline approach."

**Insight:** Visualizing success through a simplified public narrative helps teams align on the ultimate benefit of their strategy.

**Tactical advice:**
- Have every team member write a mock newspaper headline for the product 2 years out
- Use a 'blender' approach to combine common themes from these headlines into a single winning aspiration

*Timestamp: 00:42:18*


## Christina Wodtke
*Christina Wodtke*

> "if you think about strategy as a strongly held hypothesis about a way to win in the market and fulfill our vision, then you can say, "Well, our mission is this, or vision..." ... Strategy answers those questions. They say, "We're going to have a game. It's going to be an Apple Arcade. We have a hypothesis that's actually going to help us.""

**Insight:** Strategy is a hypothesis about how to win, sitting between the long-term mission and the quarterly OKRs.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define strategy as the specific choices (platform, business model, target) made to fulfill the mission.
- Ensure the quarterly objective is a direct step toward the strategic hypothesis.

*Timestamp: 00:21:06*

---

> "the product manager serves the business. That's their role... they need to understand business models, they need to understand how to do a target market, and what is a target market, why is that target market the right one to go after, and how is it going to grow"

**Insight:** Product managers must prioritize business viability and market strategy alongside user experience and technology.

**Tactical advice:**
- Deeply study business models (subscriptions vs. one-off sales) to understand how the company survives.
- Focus on target market selection and growth trends as core PM responsibilities.

*Timestamp: 01:00:52*


## Chris Hutchins
*Chris Hutchins*

> "you have to state your vision and your mission and why you're here, every all-hands. It seems so crazy because it's core to you why we would build this, what it's purposes, why it's amazing... you need everyone to be able to... have a very cohesive narrative in their head."

**Insight:** Constant repetition of the product vision is necessary to ensure the entire organization internalizes the narrative.

**Tactical advice:**
- Share the mission and vision at every all-hands meeting
- Ensure every team member can succinctly explain why the product exists

*Timestamp: 00:13:27*

---

> "Imagine a world where someone can feel this way about their money.' And it's like, 'And then this thing will do that.' That's the product strategy. It's how you execute on it."

**Insight:** A product vision should describe the desired emotional state or world for the user, while the strategy explains the execution.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on the 'feeling' or benefit you want the user to have
- Distinguish between the aspirational vision and the tactical strategy

*Timestamp: 00:17:22*


## Chip Conley
*Chip Conley*

> "Ultimately, we came up with the idea that we were in the belong anywhere business. Airbnb was not in home sharing, we were in belonging anywhere."

**Insight:** A powerful product vision moves beyond the functional 'what' (home sharing) to the emotional 'why' (belonging).

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the 'unrecognized need' at the top of the customer pyramid to define your vision
- Use the vision as an organizing principle for marketing and host education

*Timestamp: 00:55:49*

---

> "The customer pyramid, briefly... is meeting expectations is the base, meeting desires is in the middle, and then meeting unrecognized needs."

**Insight:** True product innovation comes from identifying and meeting the needs customers haven't yet articulated.

**Tactical advice:**
- Map product features against expectations, desires, and unrecognized needs

*Timestamp: 00:55:18*


## Christopher Lochhead
*Christopher Lochhead*

> "The category makes the product, the category makes the brand, the category makes the company."

**Insight:** Market categories dictate the ultimate value and perception of the products and brands within them.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on designing the market space rather than just the product features.

*Timestamp: 00:14:51*

---

> "Legendary entrepreneurs don't just think they know the future is going to be different, because they're designing that different future. And the problem they're focused on matters to them so much that the fact that the problem continues to persist makes them batshit crazy."

**Insight:** Visionary leadership involves an obsession with a future state where a specific problem no longer exists.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify a problem that drives you 'insane' and design a future where it is solved.

*Timestamp: 00:44:12*


## Claire Hughes Johnson
*Claire Hughes Johnson*

> "The mission is one line... you need a little more meat behind that... Articulating that, because until I said that to you... you might not understand why we invested in certain things or why it meant so much to us in terms of our user experience and the mission."

**Insight:** A clear mission and long-term goals provide the necessary context for employees to make the right independent choices.

**Tactical advice:**
- Draft a one-line mission statement that is aspirational but intellectual
- Define 3-5 long-term goals (3-5 year horizon) that explain why the company exists
- Use these goals to explain the rationale behind specific product investments

*Timestamp: 00:53:47*


## David Placek
*David Placek*

> "We really do have to help people think about, 'It's not about the past. You're actually creating the future.' And we really talk to people and emphasize the idea, 'This isn't a name you're creating. We're creating an experience for you.'"

**Insight:** A name is a tool for defining the future experience of a product, not just reflecting its current state.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on the desired future behavior and experience when selecting a name

*Timestamp: 00:09:43*


## Dalton Caldwell
*Dalton Caldwell*

> "It is only a tarpit if it seems like it's not. If it's just a regular idea that is hard, that is not a tarpit. The weird aspect of what we call a tarpit idea is an idea that a lot of people come up with and then it seems like an unsolved problem and you get lots of positive feedback for. Right? And you have a really good set of arguments that it's a really good startup idea. And that's different than a bad startup idea."

**Insight:** Founders must distinguish between 'good' ideas and 'tarpit' ideas—problems that seem attractive and get positive feedback but are structurally difficult to solve profitably.

**Tactical advice:**
- Be skeptical of ideas that receive easy, polite validation but have a history of failure (e.g., friend coordination apps)
- Look for structural reasons why an 'obvious' problem remains unsolved before committing to it

*Timestamp: 00:24:10*


## Dylan Field
*Dylan Field 2.0*

> "I think for us we had a framing of, we're going to go trace a workflow. If you've got an idea, go express it through Slides or hop in FigJam and brainstorm with your team. Okay, what's next? Go design, hop in Figma Design. If you need to go to development after that, Dev Mode will help you take you there."

**Insight:** Expand product lines by identifying and 'tracing' the user's end-to-end workflow.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify gaps in the user's journey from idea to finished product
- Create separate product surfaces for distinct stages of the workflow (e.g., brainstorming vs. high-fidelity design)

*Timestamp: 00:32:27*

---

> "You have to go from strength to strength, and you can't always just be obsessed with what's the next biggest TAM... we looked to the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the start of Figma, and it was like 250,000 designers in the world was what it said. Probably wrong at the time, but also it was a point in time and the industry is about to change."

**Insight:** Don't be constrained by current market size (TAM) if you have a strong intuition that the industry is shifting.

**Tactical advice:**
- Prioritize following the user workflow over descending TAM lists
- Look for trends where value is moving 'up the stack' to predict market expansion

*Timestamp: 00:36:59*


## Edwin Chen
*Edwin Chen*

> "I would say don't pivot. Don't put scale. Don't hire that Stanford grad who simply wants to add a hot company to your resume, just build the one thing only you can build, a thing that wouldn't exist without the insight and expertise that only you have."

**Insight:** True innovation comes from a steadfast commitment to a unique insight rather than constant pivoting to find market fit.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the unique problem that only your specific expertise can solve
- Resist the urge to pivot frequently in search of easy growth

*Timestamp: 00:29:20*


## Eeke de Milliano
*Eeke de Milliano*

> "Crazy Ideas... David will send out a blank doc to the org and it's titled Crazy Ideas. The Prompt is, 'Crazy ideas are ideas that we shouldn't, obviously, do. There's a 90% chance that they make no sense. But in the 10% chance that they do, they will make a 10x to 100x difference.'"

**Insight:** A low-stakes, company-wide 'Crazy Ideas' document can surface high-leverage opportunities that standard planning misses.

**Tactical advice:**
- Circulate a blank 'Crazy Ideas' document annually
- Encourage ideas that have a high probability of failure but massive potential upside

*Timestamp: 00:25:39*


## Eoghan McCabe
*Eoghan McCabe*

> "Strategically we were all over the place and I said, 'We're doing service.' ... It was the type of decision that where I had to practice the professional CEO approach, which is, 'Hey folks, what do you all think? Let's take everyone's input. Let's put it all down on a spreadsheet.' ... I said, 'Sorry, this is what we're doing.'"

**Insight:** In a pivot, the leader must unilaterally pick a 'lane' to end strategic dilution, even if it is unpopular.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the single most promising market opportunity (e.g., Customer Service).
- Explicitly stop work on secondary products or segments to focus resources.

*Timestamp: 00:27:20*


## Eric Simons
*Eric Simons*

> "WebContainer was the bet, that we made the company on. Just to be clear. StackBlitz was a browser-based, deep technology play on, 'Can we make a web assembly based operating system that can boot in a browser, in like a hundred milliseconds, and run full on development tool chains?'"

**Insight:** A strong product vision can be built on a 'deep technology play' that anticipates new browser capabilities before they are widely utilized.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify emerging platform capabilities (like WebAssembly) that enable previously impossible architectures
- Commit to a long-term technical bet even if the immediate problem-solution fit isn't clear

*Timestamp: 00:20:21*


## Evan LaPointe
*Evan LaPointe*

> "Your brain is going to sort those ideas into believed, believable, kind of conceivable and inconceivable... A lot of the vision thinking and dialogue that happens inside of businesses directly activates people's inconceivable response without any self-awareness that, that's a personal problem, not a objective problem."

**Insight:** Visionary ideas often fail because they trigger an 'inconceivable' neurological response in stakeholders who lack the same openness or context.

**Tactical advice:**
- Recognize your own 'unbelievable' threshold and when your brain is rejecting an idea based on personality rather than logic.
- Translate visionary ideas into 'believable' language for stakeholders who are high in conscientiousness and low in openness.

*Timestamp: 00:29:50*


## Ethan Evans
*Ethan Evans 2.0*

> "To invent systematically, first you do need to be somewhat of an expert in whatever area you want to invent... then the second thing people don't do is they don't spend dedicated time actually thinking. They feel like, 'Invention is just going to come to me.' When I want to invent, I get away from all my devices. I go in a room with the problem I have, and I force myself to actually concentrate on what do I know and how can I invent?"

**Insight:** Systematic invention requires deep domain expertise combined with dedicated, distraction-free thinking time.

**Tactical advice:**
- Block off two hours of dedicated thinking time at least once a month
- Remove all digital devices to ensure deep concentration on a specific problem
- Try combining two existing, unrelated concepts to generate a new invention

*Timestamp: 00:30:22*


## Fareed Mosavat
*Fareed Mosavat*

> "The way I think about product work... first, feature work... second is growth work... third is what we call product market fit expansion... and then there's the fourth that is always forgotten by a lot of PMs which is scaling work."

**Insight:** A comprehensive product strategy must balance a portfolio across four distinct types of work: features, growth, PMF expansion, and scaling.

**Tactical advice:**
- Categorize your current roadmap items into these four buckets to ensure a balanced portfolio
- Identify which type of work you are naturally an expert in and intentionally build knowledge in the other three
- Recognize that 'scaling work' includes not just technical debt but also 'user scaling' problems like trust and safety

*Timestamp: 00:41:14*


## Gaurav Misra
*Gaurav Misra*

> "A lot of it was done based on this type of pillar-based thinking of this is our mission, this is what we're trying to do, does it fit within or is it outside?"

**Insight:** Use a clear mission and core pillars to filter out distracting trends and decide which features to reject.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define core product pillars (e.g., private sharing, safety) to filter out features that don't align with the mission.
- Reject features that conflict with the mission, even if they offer high engagement potential.

*Timestamp: 00:58:15*


## Geoff Charles
*Geoff Charles*

> "Strategy is about how do we get to our goals? And it's not a roadmap and it's not a vision, it's something right in between that... Figure out why we're uniquely positioned as a company to get after that goal."

**Insight:** A strong strategy identifies the company's 'right to win' by leveraging unique internal advantages.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify components or expertise that can be reused to increase velocity.
- Define the 'right to win' based on existing infrastructure, data, or customer access.

*Timestamp: 00:37:58*


## Gibson Biddle
*Gibson Biddle*

> "The job is to delight customers. Like Peter Thiel, his book, From Zero to One. The job of an entrepreneur at the beginning is just to find out something that's 10X better. Delight is trying to work in that magnitude."

**Insight:** Product vision should aim for 10X improvement rather than incremental satisfaction to truly delight customers.

**Tactical advice:**
- Aim for 'delight' rather than just 'satisfaction'
- Look for 10X improvements over existing solutions

> "to delight customers in hard to copy margin enhancing ways. So, there's kind of these three parts, customers, hard to copy, margin enhancing."

**Insight:** A robust product strategy must simultaneously delight users, create defensible advantages, and improve business profitability.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify specific features that provide customer delight
- Determine what makes the product 'hard to copy' (e.g., brand, network effects)
- Ensure the strategy includes 'margin enhancement' (monetization)

> "As a very young company, you don't have a separate product strategy from a company strategy. The product and company strategy are the same. As you start growing, you have a go-to market strategy, product strategy, et cetera, et cetera."

**Insight:** In early-stage startups, product and company strategy are synonymous; they only diverge as the organization scales and adds complexity.

**Tactical advice:**
- Write a dedicated product strategy doc once the company reaches 20-25 people to articulate implicit choices
- Ensure the product strategy clearly defines which customer segments are being served

## Hamilton Helmer
*Hamilton Helmer*

> "Power requires a benefit and a barrier, so he's taking care of the benefit part by saying a castle, you have to have a pretty good understanding of why it's a castle and not a shack."

**Insight:** A durable product vision must identify both the value created (the benefit) and the structural reason competitors cannot copy it (the barrier).

**Tactical advice:**
- Evaluate your product strategy using the 'Benefit and Barrier' test to ensure long-term value.

*Timestamp: 00:00:04*

---

> "Strategy is a long time concept. You're looking far out in the future... if you focus on value that narrows what you think about and allows you to get rather concise and offer up advice to founders about what they need to pay attention to."

**Insight:** Effective strategy focuses on the long-term fundamental determinants of business value, specifically the Net Present Value (NPV) of expected cash flow.

**Tactical advice:**
- Narrow your strategic focus to the factors that drive long-term business value rather than short-term tactical wins.

## Howie Liu
*Howie Liu*

> "the best way to innovate on the product is not incrementally split over all these different little surface areas, but actually to have a bigger, more step function vision of how this product needs to make a leap"

**Insight:** Avoid incrementalism by focusing on holistic, step-function leaps for the product rather than optimizing small surface areas in isolation.

**Tactical advice:**
- CEO should play a CPO role to maintain product vision
- Focus on 'global maxima' breakthroughs rather than local optimizations within fiefdoms

*Timestamp: 01:16:35*


## Ian McAllister
*Ian McAllister*

> "At our scale we got to hunt for bigger elephants. And so I think at any scale as a PM, whatever your idea is or whatever your solution or the problem you're solving, take a minute at the beginning to say, could this be bigger? Could this be a bigger thing and more impactful than the initial idea, even if the initial idea sounds big?"

**Insight:** Senior PMs should consistently challenge the scale of their ideas to ensure they are pursuing the maximum possible impact.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ask 'could this be bigger?' at the start of every project
- Start with a large vision even if you begin execution with a small step

*Timestamp: 00:24:04*

> "Most people operate within a box... take that really wide view of what product is across disciplines... take that really wide view of what success for your product is and not have the blinders on its product or tech. It's anything. It's anything that influences the success and your customers' success."

**Insight:** Thinking big involves looking beyond functional boundaries to address any barrier to the product's success.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify and knock down constraints regardless of which department owns them
- Think like an owner of the entire business, not just the technical feature

*Timestamp: 00:30:58*


## Ivan Zhao
*Ivan Zhao*

> "Our realization is actually let's hide our vision, which is everybody can create their software in the form factor that people do care. So what kind of tool do people use every day? Productivity software. It took us two years to realize we need to build a productivity tool. We called it sugar-coated broccoli. People don't want to eat the broccoli but people like sugar, so it gave them the sugar then hide your broccoli inside of it."

**Insight:** Successful products often package a radical long-term vision inside a familiar, high-utility form factor that users already understand and need.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the 'sugar' (the immediate utility users want) to deliver the 'broccoli' (your deeper vision/technology).
- Avoid building purely for your own values if it results in a product that the mass market doesn't care about.

*Timestamp: 00:00:05*

> "Building for something you want the world to have is building for your value. You have some taste. You have some aesthetic. There are different energy. You need to create a balance. Too much of yourself. Then there's no users. Then you're just doing our project. And too much for business, you're building a commodity."

**Insight:** Product vision must balance personal taste and values with market demand to avoid creating either an unusable art project or a soulless commodity.

**Tactical advice:**
- Audit your product to see if it leans too heavily toward personal aesthetic or pure business optimization.
- Use personal values as a durable energy source during difficult building periods.

*Timestamp: 00:00:44*

> "We ship non-Lego pieces into our product. We're still there. We're still cleaning up part of it. That's a realization. It's like going back to the value part, it's like if you create this thing called a product or business, you attract people are value aligned to it. Then if you're trying to optimize too much on this competition revenue side of things, forced to introducing something anti-your-value, then the system, it's like there's organ rejection with your employees, with your customers."

**Insight:** Violating the core architectural principles of your product (e.g., modularity) to chase specific features can lead to 'organ rejection' from the user base and internal team.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ensure new features align with the product's fundamental 'abstraction' (e.g., building blocks vs. hard-coded features).
- Be willing to spend more time building a modular solution rather than a quick, hard-coded fix.

*Timestamp: 00:45:36*


## Jackie Bavaro
*Jackie Bavaro*

> "I basically realized that there's three key components to strategy... Vision: This is your inspiring picture of what the future looks like... Strategic framework: This is where you're saying, 'Here is the market we're going after. Here's what success looks like. And here are our big bets on what we think it takes to win that market.'... And then the third part is the roadmap."

**Insight:** A complete product strategy must integrate an inspiring vision, a logical framework for winning, and a feasibility-checked roadmap.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define 'big bets' that explain how you will win your target market
- Ensure the vision is an 'inspiring picture' that motivates the team

*Timestamp: 24:01*

---

> "I think a good strategy is all about connecting the dots. Connecting the dots from this high level business goal of, 'We want to increase revenue by this much' to, 'This is the feature we're going to do.' And it might have many, many dots in between to help get people from one to the other."

**Insight:** The core of strategic thinking is the ability to link high-level business objectives to specific product features.

**Tactical advice:**
- Map every feature back to a specific business goal (e.g., revenue targets)
- Identify the 'missing dots' or assumptions in the logic between a goal and a feature

*Timestamp: 26:40*

---

> "One of the great ways to learn strategy is to cross apply strategy from other places... consistency versus comprehensiveness. They said 'Is our product the kind of product where it's better to have consistent results all the time... or is it better to have comprehensiveness where even though the experience will be different each time we give you a result every time?'"

**Insight:** Strategic frameworks can be borrowed and adapted from entirely different product categories.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look for 'eigenquestions' (like consistency vs. comprehensiveness) used by other successful products
- Study how leaders in different industries frame their trade-offs

*Timestamp: 31:27*


## Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky
*Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky 2.0*

> "If we solve this problem for this customer with this approach, we think they're going to choose it over the competitors because of differentiator one and differentiator two."

**Insight:** A product's strategic vision can be distilled into a single 'founding hypothesis' that aligns the team on the path forward.

**Tactical advice:**
- Draft a 'founding hypothesis' sentence that includes: customer, problem, approach, competitors, and differentiators.

*Timestamp: 00:16:35*


## Janna Bastow
*Janna Bastow*

> "The product vision template, you might actually recognize it from the Geoffrey Moore's Crossing the Chasm book. It's the elevator pitch template... It asks things like, for your target customer, who the statement of need or the opportunity. The product name is a product category. What's the reason to buy? And then say, unlike this alternative our product, and then say what this statement of differentiation is."

**Insight:** A structured template helps clarify the target customer, the problem, and the unique differentiation of the product.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use the Geoffrey Moore elevator pitch template to define product vision: [Target Customer] who [Statement of Need], the [Product Name] is a [Product Category] that [Reason to Buy], unlike [Alternative], our product [Statement of Differentiation]

> "From an entrepreneurship standpoint, it truly is about what insight do I have? Why am I so lucky to have this insight? Why in a world of a million entrepreneurs who are thinking, who are smart, who are trying everything, why am I in the position where I likely have an insight that others do not?"

**Insight:** A strong product vision must be built on a unique, independent insight that differentiates you from the rest of the market.

**Tactical advice:**
- Question why you specifically are positioned to have a unique market insight
- Avoid 'consensus' thinking to find alpha in the market

*Timestamp: 00:48:30*


## Jiaona Zhang
*Jiaona Zhang*

> "understand why people love you, double down on that and then whatever else you build around it... go back to, again, what's the core of our advantage and how can that be something we leverage in delivering a really great product experience for our users in X adjacent area or x add-on?"

**Insight:** A strong product strategy requires identifying the core reason users love the product and ensuring all new investments reinforce that primary advantage.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the 'alpha' or core strength of the product (e.g., Dropbox's simplicity or Airbnb's unique homes)
- Avoid chasing competitors into areas that don't leverage your core advantage
- Ensure multi-product expansions still tie back to the original value proposition

*Timestamp: 00:56:34*


## John Cutler
*John Cutler*

> "The Jeff Bezos thing, that the success of today was set in motion three years ago, that product is a layer cake and that you are layering on decisions, the success you're having now is a layer cake of decisions from the last bunch of years that you're doing it."

**Insight:** Product success is a cumulative 'layer cake' of strategic decisions made years in advance, rather than just recent actions.

*Timestamp: 00:35:26*


## John Mark Nickels
*John Mark Nickels*

> "I try to just close my eyes and imagine the future as far out as I can. It's like five years from now, 10 years from now, whatever. And it's develop a really salient picture of what that looks like. It's like, we could do this right now, it's okay. 10 years from now, what could San Francisco look like? Or some city? What happens to the parking spaces? Are there still parking garages? Are those parks now?"

**Insight:** Effective vision building involves deep visualization of the future state of the world, independent of your specific product.

**Tactical advice:**
- Carve out distraction-free time to visualize the industry 5-10 years out
- Identify specific physical or societal changes that will likely occur (e.g., repurposed parking spaces)

*Timestamp: 00:26:09*

---

> "One example might be, why do we need a 4,000 pound vehicle to move a human three miles? Okay, well... Or even a couple of humans. We do an Uber Pool or a Share, and you move two humans or three humans, even then that's pretty inefficient. If you think about just the physics there, the energy expenditure."

**Insight:** Use first-principles thinking to identify fundamental inefficiencies in the current world as a starting point for vision.

**Tactical advice:**
- Question the basic physics or economics of current solutions
- Look for massive inefficiencies (like vehicle weight vs. passenger weight) to find product opportunities

*Timestamp: 00:25:15*


## Jules Walter
*Jules Walter*

> "What I do specifically is I try to identify what's the best practice for something. For example, let's say strategy... Can you help me understand what are people at this company... where you think have done a great job at strategy or what are examples of artifacts? Then I get these artifacts and I reverse engineering them."

**Insight:** Master product strategy by reverse-engineering successful strategy documents from top performers to understand their structure and the questions they answer.

**Tactical advice:**
- Request examples of high-quality strategy artifacts from respected peers or leaders.
- Analyze successful documents to identify the core questions, data points, and frameworks used.
- Observe the iteration process of a strategy document rather than just the final version to understand the trade-offs made.

*Timestamp: 00:35:46*


## Julie Zhuo
*Julie Zhuo 2.0*

> "Purpose is like, 'What are we here to do? What's our North Star?' And I think it's very hard to actually convey that if you don't have conviction yourself... you have to really check in with yourself on like, 'Wait, I know we're told to do this and this is what we have to do, but how do we really feel about it?'"

**Insight:** A manager cannot effectively lead a team toward a vision if they do not personally have conviction in that purpose.

**Tactical advice:**
- Check your own belief in the strategy before attempting to lead others.
- Engage in dialogue with leadership to find alignment if you lack conviction.

*Timestamp: 01:10:21*


## Katie Dill
*Katie Dill*

> "Reach for the stars and land on the moon. And what I mean by that is that vision work is really important... vision work that absolutely does look at the entirety of the experience, a comprehensive approach, a journey approach, and thinks about how these various things may come together to be better, and sketch out the ideal version... show what that ideal version is, because if you don't know what that is, what are the chances that you're going to increment yourself to the right outcome in the end?"

**Insight:** A comprehensive North Star vision prevents teams from getting stuck in local maxima through purely incremental improvements.

**Tactical advice:**
- Sketch out the 'ideal version' of the product 2 years out
- Work backwards from the ideal vision to determine what to ship first

*Timestamp: 01:08:50*


## Kayvon Beykpour
*Kayvon Beykpour*

> "It was also just storytelling and just repetitive storytelling around this is the vision, these are the bets we're making. Here's why. And you can't just tell that story once."

**Insight:** Internal alignment on product vision requires constant, repetitive storytelling to stick.

**Tactical advice:**
- Communicate the product vision and the 'why' behind bets repeatedly to both internal and external stakeholders.

*Timestamp: 00:35:07*


## Ken Norton
*Ken Norton*

> "What would it be like, in my case, to lead with purpose and be decisive and lead with vision and to have other people felt like they're being brought along and listened to and participated and create safe spaces for other people?"

**Insight:** Effective vision-led leadership requires balancing decisiveness with active listening and psychological safety.

**Tactical advice:**
- Shift from a reactive mindset (solving problems) to a creative mindset (leading with vision)
- Ensure the vision-setting process makes the team feel heard and safe

*Timestamp: 00:29:47*


## Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter
*Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter*

> "Probably the craziest one is just that this thing is going to be the voice of the people. It's going to represent the voice of people. It's not going to represent the company's voice. So it is not a tech company deciding what shows."

**Insight:** Defining a product as a neutral platform for users rather than a corporate editorial voice can solve scale and trust issues.

**Tactical advice:**
- Establish core principles (like decentralization or transparency) that the company cannot override
- Design systems where the company has no 'button' to manually change outcomes, forcing reliance on the algorithm

*Timestamp: 01:11:16*


## Karri Saarinen
*Karri Saarinen*

> "I personally have this belief that productivity software should be, and especially company software should be opinionated... Being opinionated, I think the value it provides people is you don't have to think too much or spend more time on the tool than you do on your actual work."

**Insight:** Opinionated software increases user productivity by removing the cognitive load of configuration and workflow design.

**Tactical advice:**
- Design for a specific target user rather than trying to build a generalized solution for everyone.
- Provide strong default workflows so users can focus on their work instead of the tool.

*Timestamp: 00:39:02*


## Kevin Aluwi
*Kevin Aluwi*

> "Don't just copy, because Gojek was not an Uber clone, even though that was kind of how some investors or analysts talk about us, we were focused on a solution that was uniquely an Indonesian phenomenon, the motorcycle taxi driver. And this led to both product and branding innovation."

**Insight:** Product vision should be rooted in unique local market dynamics rather than simply cloning successful global models.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify unique local phenomena or problems to solve rather than defaulting to global clones
- Adapt product strategy to the specific behaviors of the local population

*Timestamp: 00:51:24*


## Kunal Shah
*Kunal Shah*

> "Every time you see that the product efficiency delta is greater than or equal to four, three things happen. It is irreversible. Second is that you have a very high tolerance for it to fail. If Uber fails a little bit, will you say, “Oh my God, I'm going to really stop using it?” No. And the third thing is what I call the UBP, ‘Unique Brag-worthy Proposition.’ Every time humans unlock a Delta 4 product or service, they cannot stop talking or sharing about it."

**Insight:** A product must be at least 4 points more efficient than the current solution (on a 1-10 scale) to become irreversible and generate organic growth.

**Tactical advice:**
- Score the current solution's efficiency from 1 to 10.
- Score your proposed product's efficiency from 1 to 10.
- Ensure the delta is at least 4 to guarantee high user tolerance and low CAC.
- Identify the 'Unique Brag-worthy Proposition' (UBP) that triggers word-of-mouth.

*Timestamp: 00:07:05*


## Lane Shackleton
*Lane Shackleton*

> "The core insight here is that you want your teams to feel like they're building a cathedral and not laying bricks. And I think it's really, really easy to do when PMs are really busy on a day-to-day to just be one task after the other, really execution oriented and maybe not take the time to help the team take a broader frame, open the aperture a little bit and have a view of what the cathedral is."

**Insight:** Great product leaders ensure every team member understands the 'cathedral' (the vision) rather than just the 'bricks' (tasks).

**Tactical advice:**
- Show different facets of the vision: write-ups, metrics, directional mocks, and 'billboard' examples.
- Take the mystery out of constraints by visualizing the long-term destination.

*Timestamp: 00:25:14*


## Marc Benioff
*Marc Benioff*

> "I want to get to the future first and welcome our customers there."

**Insight:** A visionary product leader's goal is to anticipate future technological shifts and build the infrastructure before the customer even realizes they need it.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look for emerging technologies (like agents or robotics) years before they become mainstream
- Build the 'future' state and then guide customers toward it

*Timestamp: 55:43*


## Marily Nika
*Marily Nika*

> "Even when I'm at work and I am trying to come up with a nice mission statement, when we're PMs will come up with mission statements, it's just crucial part and it's where the core begins. You want to get people excited, you want to get people inspired. There is nothing I can write that's going to be as good as what ChatGPT looks like."

**Insight:** AI can help refine mission statements to be more inspiring and accessible to a broad audience.

**Tactical advice:**
- Draft a mission statement and ask ChatGPT to rewrite it for clarity and inspiration.
- Ensure mission statements are simple enough for a non-expert or even a child to understand.

*Timestamp: 00:06:04*


## Manik Gupta
*Manik Gupta*

> "Generally you would say the CPO is responsible for driving the product vision for the company, and that product vision cannot be divorced from the company vision. Oftentimes this is actually what also creates conflict within the leadership team, where the product vision is... people are coming up with these grandiose plans... but then it's not really grounded in the reality of where the company is. Anyways, it's around product vision and making sure it's coherent with the company vision."

**Insight:** A successful product vision must be inextricably linked to the overall company vision and grounded in the organization's current reality.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ensure the product vision is coherent with the company's strategic goals to avoid leadership conflict.
- Avoid 'grandiose' plans that aren't grounded in the company's actual capabilities or market position.

*Timestamp: 00:40:24*


## Maggie Crowley
*Maggie Crowley*

> "You should be able to walk all the way from your company's mission down to the individual priority on your team and see the logic chain and why you got there."

**Insight:** A robust strategy document connects high-level mission to tactical execution through a clear, documented logic chain.

**Tactical advice:**
- Start with the company mission and current business goals
- Document the landscape: market point of view, competitors, and SWOT analysis
- Identify the specific opportunity and what must be true for it to work
- Sequence the plan based on what you would do if no one else had an opinion

*Timestamp: 00:35:04*


## Marty Cagan
*Marty Cagan 2.0*

> "Product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy... that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place."

**Insight:** Product strategy is a leadership responsibility focused on making strategic bets and focus decisions rather than a task for individual teams.

**Tactical advice:**
- Leaders should define the strategic bets and focus areas.
- Teams should be given the latitude to figure out the best way to solve the problems within those strategic bets.

*Timestamp: 00:45:03*


## Matt Mullenweg
*Matt Mullenweg*

> "And I think your audience in particular, is great software ever created by committee or does it more often reflects a vision of a leader or something that can allow us to... and I think particularly WordPress not just remaining relevant but actually accelerating growth over huge technological shifts over the past two decades."

**Insight:** Maintaining product relevance across generational technological shifts requires a singular, strong vision rather than consensus-based decision-making.

**Tactical advice:**
- Avoid 'design by committee' for core product direction
- Empower a visionary leader to make unpopular decisions that ensure long-term survival

*Timestamp: 01:02:24*


## Melissa Perri + Denise Tilles
*Melissa Perri + Denise Tilles*

> "As a chief product officer, ARR is interesting to me, but it's not as interesting to me as ARR by customer segment. It's not as interesting as ARR by product line. It's not as interesting if I take that and then look at it by retention or adoption by product or feature set... When we start to put those lenses on it, they now become a really powerful strategy insight."

**Insight:** Strategic vision is informed by granular data cuts that reveal how specific segments interact with specific product lines.

**Tactical advice:**
- Analyze ARR and retention by specific customer segments rather than just at the aggregate level
- Monitor feature adoption by segment to validate if strategic shifts (e.g., moving upmarket) are working

*Timestamp: 00:31:22*


## Mayur Kamat
*Mayur Kamat*

> "Strategy is a little bit overrated for product. For most product managers, your strategy should be, 'How fast can I go from hypothesis to data?'"

**Insight:** Product strategy is often just packaged intuition; true strategy is the speed at which you turn hypotheses into validated data.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on the speed of the hypothesis-to-data loop rather than long-term strategic documents.
- Use data to override the 'loudest voice in the room' or executive intuition.

*Timestamp: 00:00:45*


## Melanie Perkins
*Melanie Perkins*

> "I really like to start by just imagining what is the future that you actually want Right now? I have a wall in my house in my office, which is my vision for what I'd like the world to look like in 2050."

**Insight:** Effective product vision starts with a long-term, idealistic view of the future rather than current constraints.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a physical or digital 'vision wall' for a long-term horizon (e.g., 2050)
- Define 'wild success' and 'terrible failure' for a 10-year period to clarify the desired direction

*Timestamp: 00:08:17*

> "So we have this concept of chaos to clarity. Every idea starts in the chaos side, and then you have to work all the way to the other side, which is clarity. That very first step at the far end of chaos was quite an embarrassing step actually, because you don't have mastery at that point."

**Insight:** Move ideas from 'chaos' to 'clarity' through incremental steps like writing, deck creation, and prototyping.

**Tactical advice:**
- Start by simply writing an idea down to move it out of your head
- Use pitch decks to refine and communicate thinking before building
- Accept that the first step of a vision will feel 'embarrassing' due to a lack of mastery

*Timestamp: 00:11:49*

---

> "So our mission, empower world design, empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every language on every device, and just take those things very literally."

**Insight:** Break a broad mission into literal pillars to guide long-term product expansion.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define mission pillars (e.g., 'every language', 'every device') and systematically check them off over years

*Timestamp: 00:48:31*


## Melissa Perri
*Melissa*

> "I once asked all the executive team at a healthcare company, what's the vision for this company? And they said, to be the backbone of healthcare. And I said, what does that mean? And they couldn't elaborate. Nobody could elaborate on that. And I said, cool, that's a tagline, but it's not a vision."

**Insight:** A vision is not a marketing tagline; it must be a concrete description of what the company will manifest into over the next five to ten years.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ask leaders to elaborate on vague vision statements to see if they have a shared understanding of the future state.
- Define who the future customers will be and how the value provided will differ from today.

*Timestamp: 23:57*

---

> "A vision should be concrete enough where people can picture what it will be in their head. It can't be a fluffy... be the backbone of healthcare. What does that mean? I don't get it. So people need to be able to look at a vision and say, I can understand that we're going to get there one day."

**Insight:** Effective visions are lofty enough to require iteration but concrete enough for employees to visualize the end state.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ensure the vision is far enough away that it cannot be achieved by building just one thing.
- Avoid making the vision a description of the current state of the product.

*Timestamp: 36:07*

---

> "I love reading a vision that's like, we're not going to be like that. And that, to me, is so powerful because you're like, oh, okay, we're not going to copy that. We're not going to go after that."

**Insight:** A strong vision provides clarity by explicitly stating what the company will not do or become.

**Tactical advice:**
- Explicitly list competitors or market behaviors the company intends to avoid copying.

*Timestamp: 38:15*

## Michael Truell
*Michael Truell*

> "Our goal with Cursor is to invent sort of a new type of programming, a very different way to build software, that's kind of just distilled down into you describing the intent to the computer for what you want in the most concise way possible, and really distilled down to just defining how you think the software should work, and how you think it should look."

**Insight:** The future of software development is moving toward high-level intent specification rather than manual text editing of formal languages.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on the 'what' (logic and intent) rather than the 'how' (under-the-hood implementation).
- Aim for a representation of logic that is human-readable and human-editable, moving toward pseudocode.

*Timestamp: 00:04:45*

---

> "I think that more and more, being an engineer will start to feel like being a logic designer, and really, it will be about specifying your intent for how exactly you want everything to work. It'd be more about the whats, and a little bit less about how exactly you're going to do things under the hood."

**Insight:** Engineering is evolving into 'logic design,' where the primary value is defining how software should function rather than writing the syntax.

**Tactical advice:**
- Develop 'taste' for how software should work and look as a primary competitive advantage.

*Timestamp: 00:09:22*


## Mihika Kapoor
*Mihika Kapoor*

> "My take is that vision is everything. It is really important to create a vision that you believe in, that your team believes in and that your company believes in. Because the reality of the product development cycle is that it's so messy, it's so chaotic... it's so important to be anchored on that singular vision because then any step along the way feels like forward progress."

**Insight:** A strong vision acts as a necessary anchor that transforms chaotic pivots and setbacks into meaningful forward progress.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ensure vision is inseparable from user research and team input rather than created in a vacuum
- Root the vision in engineering feasibility from the beginning
- Use a 'pain point, solution, proof point' structure for vision pitches

*Timestamp: 00:08:12*

---

> "I think that when you're actually presenting a vision, one of the most important things is that there is a single artifact that the team is creating together... you want for everyone to feel incredible ownership and incredible passion about this combined deliverable, so that it's a unified team who believes a singular set of insights."

**Insight:** Creating a single, unified artifact for a vision sprint ensures the entire cross-functional team owns the insights equally.

**Tactical advice:**
- Avoid siloed deliverables like separate research readouts and design crits
- Lean into high-fidelity prototypes and mocks to make the vision 'felt' emotionally

> "Great founders, pattern breakers back cast, they say, it's a given that the future has to be radically different for me to be a big winner, and so, I'm going to look for radically different futures and work backwards from those radically different futures."

**Insight:** Breakthrough vision is created through 'backcasting'—starting with a radically different future and working backward—rather than forecasting from the present.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify a future that is radically different from today
- Work backwards from that future to determine what needs to be built now
- Avoid the 'comparison trap' by proposing a future that denies the premise of current rules

*Timestamp: 00:31:23*

> "The way startups win is because it proposes a radically different future. Disorients the incumbent and chaotically moves people to that different future."

**Insight:** A successful product vision should disorient incumbents by proposing a future they are not prepared for.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on being radically different rather than just 'better'
- Look for ways to change the subject of the market entirely

> "Movements have a five act structure... dream, leap, fight, climb, arrive. So, the torch bearer, the reason we called that is the leaders know where they're headed, but they might not ever see it super, super clearly."

**Insight:** Leading a product vision is like being a 'torchbearer'—you provide enough light to dissipate fear and guide the team through the 'messy middle' of execution.

**Tactical advice:**
- Communicate the 'Dream' to get initial buy-in
- Use stories and ceremonies to provide 'emotional fuel' during the 'Fight' and 'Climb' phases
- Acknowledge that you don't need to see the whole future, just enough to lead the next step

> "I always used to say you can't retrofit collaboration. You have to be collaboration-first. And a lot of companies now really take that for granted. But back in mid-2000s, this was kind of a new way of building product. And so we missed that bridge."

**Insight:** Collaboration must be a core part of the initial product vision rather than a feature added later.

**Tactical advice:**
- Design for multiplayer/team workflows from the start to avoid the 'single-player' growth cap

*Timestamp: 07:20*


## Nick Turley
*Nick Turley*

> "What we envision is this entity that can help you with any task, whether or not that's at home, or at work, or at school, really any context, and it's an entity that knows what you're trying to achieve. So, unlike ChatGPT today, you don't have to describe your problem in menu to detail because it already stands your overarching goals and has context on your life"

**Insight:** The long-term vision for AI is a proactive entity with deep personal context that reduces the need for detailed prompting.

**Tactical advice:**
- Build toward a 'relationship' model where the AI remembers user goals over time
- Expand the 'action space' of the AI so it can execute tasks, not just provide information

*Timestamp: 00:10:24*

---

> "ChatGPT feels a little bit like MS-DOS. We haven't built Windows yet, and it will be obvious once we do. ... I think natural language is here to stay, but this idea that it has to be a turn-by-turn chat interaction I think is really limiting."

**Insight:** The current chat interface is a primitive starting point; the future involves more sophisticated, non-linear ways of interacting with intelligence.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look beyond the chat box for ways to communicate affordances to users
- Explore AI that can render its own UI dynamically based on the task

*Timestamp: 00:50:07*


## Nilan Peiris
*Nilan Peiris*

> "But to get to recommendation, you're going to blow your user socks off. You have to give them an experience they didn't know was previously possible. And when you are in that place of doing something that no one has ever done before, that's when you get it. So the bar is all the way up there. And to put that in context, that means figuring out how to move money instantly. That means figuring out how to drop the price all the way from six all the way down to 0.35."

**Insight:** To drive word-of-mouth, the product vision must aim for a '10x better' experience that users didn't previously think was possible.

**Tactical advice:**
- Set the product bar at 'blowing the user's socks off' rather than just functional utility
- Identify the 'theoretical minimum' cost or 'theoretical maximum' speed and aim for that as the long-term goal
- Avoid shortcuts that rely on existing infrastructure if they prevent you from fundamentally changing the user experience

> "Forest time is the idea that you make time within your week, within your month to see the forest for the trees... to elevate, to get some bird's eye view, to see the entire landscape and see the alternative paths through the current problems that you're escaping."

**Insight:** Intentional 'Forest Time' is required to ensure that the high cost of engineering execution is aimed at the right strategic goals.

**Tactical advice:**
- Schedule one full day per month specifically for strategic reflection away from daily operations.
- Use a structured worksheet to survey the 'forest' and identify alternative paths that aren't visible during daily execution.

*Timestamp: 00:57:39*


## Noam Lovinsky
*Noam Lovinsky*

> "At Thumbtack, we had principles about which sides of the marketplace we wanted to serve in which order and when we serve Thumbtack. So it was customers first, pros second, and then Thumbtack last. ... Saying Thumbtack last is the easy thing to say. Actually doing it in action I think is a very different thing."

**Insight:** Establish clear hierarchy-of-needs principles to navigate conflicts between different stakeholders in a marketplace.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a stack-ranked list of stakeholders to guide trade-off decisions
- Ensure 'business needs' are prioritized after customer and provider value to ensure long-term health

*Timestamp: 00:17:31*


## Richard Rumelt
*Richard Rumelt*

> "A strategy is a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge. It's a mixture of policy and action designed to deal with a challenge."

**Insight:** Strategy is fundamentally a design for problem-solving rather than just a set of high-level goals.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define strategy as a mixture of policy and action to address a specific challenge.

*Timestamp: 00:05:05*

---

> "The kernel... if anyone in three is missing, something's wrong. It's not really a strategy, it's something else. There has to be an understanding of the situation. There has to be a guiding policy, how are we going to deal with it? And then the coherence and action is critical."

**Insight:** A valid strategy must contain three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent actions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ensure your strategy document includes a clear diagnosis of the situation.
- Develop a guiding policy that outlines the approach to the diagnosis.
- List coherent actions that implement the policy without contradicting each other.

*Timestamp: 00:14:32*

---

> "Don't call it strategy, call it an action agenda. It's huge numbers of people out there willing to sell you advice on mission and your vision and your values... That's not true. Begin to try to identify the one or two key challenges that can actually be addressed and what are we going to do about it?"

**Insight:** Effective strategy focuses on addressable challenges rather than abstract missions or visions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Rename your strategy to an 'action agenda' to focus on execution.
- Identify one or two key challenges that are actually addressable today.

*Timestamp: 00:00:00*


## Ramesh Johari
*Ramesh Johari*

> "Uber and Airbnb are selling you the taking away of something, which is a weird thing to think about. What they're taking away is the friction of finding a place to stay. They're taking away the friction of finding a driver. In economics, we call those things transaction costs."

**Insight:** Marketplaces should be defined by the specific transaction costs and frictions they remove rather than the goods or services they facilitate.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the specific market failure or friction (e.g., trust, discovery, payment) that your platform is uniquely positioned to solve.

*Timestamp: 00:06:10*

---

> "Maybe we shouldn't talk about the concept of a marketplace founder. Really there's founders. And I think every entrepreneur... it means literally any founder is a marketplace founder. It'll be a choice they make after they grow as to whether they want to build a platform."

**Insight:** Most modern tech businesses eventually face the choice of becoming a platform or marketplace, so founders should view 'marketplace' as a scale-up strategy rather than an initial identity.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on solving a core problem for one side of the market before worrying about building a scaled marketplace infrastructure.

*Timestamp: 00:17:24*


## Ravi Mehta
*Ravi Mehta*

> "The product strategy stack is a system that helps people understand what framework they're using in order to make decisions and what's going to drive value for the business. The top of the stack is the company mission... The second thing is strategy... The next level of the strategy stack is the product strategy. And the product strategy is the connective tissue between what is the company trying to accomplish and what are the day-to-day things that the product team is doing."

**Insight:** A complete product strategy requires a logical stack connecting high-level mission to daily goals through company strategy, product strategy, and roadmaps.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define the mission as the qualitative, aspirational change you want to bring to the world.
- Ensure the strategy is 'rigorously logical' rather than just aspirational.
- Use the stack to debug issues: if goals aren't being met, check if the roadmap or strategy is misaligned.

*Timestamp: 00:19:55*

---

> "One of the things that we said with stake that we put in the ground was the strategy doc wouldn't be complete without wireframes... the reason is that oftentimes when you talk about strategy in words alone, everyone takes away a different interpretation of that strategy, whereas when you actually can show people wireframes of what the product will look like when that strategy is implemented, it creates much more alignment."

**Insight:** Visualizing the end state through wireframes is essential for ensuring stakeholders have a shared understanding of the product strategy.

**Tactical advice:**
- Include conceptual wireframes in strategy documents to force concrete decisions about trade-offs.
- Use the 'nav bar test': if your strategy doesn't dictate what the 4-5 items on a mobile nav bar are, it isn't specific enough.

*Timestamp: 00:24:41*


## Roger Martin
*Roger Martin*

> "Strategy is an integrated set of choices that compels desired customer action."

**Insight:** Strategy is not just a plan, but a cohesive set of decisions designed to influence customer behavior in a specific direction.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on the things you control to influence the one thing you don't: customer action.
- Ensure all strategic choices reinforce one another rather than acting in isolation.

*Timestamp: 00:17:48*

---

> "You have to have answers to five questions. What's your winning aspiration? Where to play? How can you win? What capabilities do you have to have that your competitors don't? And then, what enabling management systems do you have to put in place?"

**Insight:** A complete strategy requires answering five interconnected questions that link aspirations to execution.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define a 'winning aspiration' to contextualize your choices.
- Identify the specific 'where to play' (playing field) and 'how to win' (value proposition).
- Determine the 'must-have capabilities' and 'management systems' needed to sustain the advantage.

*Timestamp: 00:00:18*


## Ryan Hoover
*Ryan Hoover*

> "One- one regret is we should not have tried to expand horizontally. We should've just focused entirely vertically and- and served the tech community, you know, better and- and with more things, which is effectively what we're doing now."

**Insight:** Horizontal expansion is often harder than deepening a vertical focus, especially for community-based products.

**Tactical advice:**
- Be cautious of expanding into new categories before fully serving the core community's needs.
- Recognize that different product categories (e.g., games vs. podcasts) require fundamentally different discovery experiences.

*Timestamp: 00:31:50*


## Seth Godin
*Seth Godin*

> "Choose your customers, choose your future. Choose your competition and choose your future. Choose the source of validation and you choose your future. Choose your distribution, and you're also choosing your future."

**Insight:** Product strategy is determined by four foundational choices—customers, competition, validation, and distribution—which dictate the product's eventual trajectory.

**Tactical advice:**
- Explicitly select a 'smallest viable audience' rather than trying to appeal to everyone.
- Align the product's distribution strategy with the specific needs and behaviors of the chosen customer base.

*Timestamp: 23:31*

> "Tension is at the heart of every art form and every innovation. What we do when we launch a new product, we say, we have this thing that can do X, and now the person is imagining what their life might be like if that were true. If they fall in love with that possibility, now there's tension."

**Insight:** A compelling product vision creates tension by presenting a gap between the user's current reality and a desirable future possibility.

**Tactical advice:**
- Articulate a 'remarkable promise' that creates emotional tension for the potential user.
- Ensure the product actually delivers on the promise to resolve that tension positively.

*Timestamp: 27:53*


## Shreyas Doshi
*Shreyas Doshi*

> "Google taught me the... power of thinking really big. And I know it sounds like a platitude, but really big. And I only actually realized that when I left Google and I started working with the other teams and these were all capable teams and I was struck by how many teams just limited the potential of what they could achieve."

**Insight:** A core part of product vision is the default habit of expanding the scale of an opportunity rather than accepting current limitations.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ask 'What does it take to make it bigger?' for every $1M or $10M opportunity.
- Be willing to let go of smaller opportunities to focus on billion-dollar potential.

*Timestamp: 00:14:38*

---

> "Most execution problems that I encounter in a high performing environment where everybody has the right intentions are actually not execution problems, they are either strategy problems or interpersonal problems or cultural problems."

**Insight:** Persistent execution failures, such as team misalignment, are often symptoms of a missing or unclear strategy rather than poor project management.

**Tactical advice:**
- If a 'band-aid' solution like a new review process fails, investigate if the teams are pursuing different or undefined strategies.

*Timestamp: 00:55:18*

---

> "Twitter's biggest problem is a product strategy problem. The reason they're struggling is they don't have a real product strategy. Now, of course, attempts were made to create a product strategy, but it wasn't a real compelling, cohesive product strategy."

**Insight:** A company can have great talent and network effects but still fail to meet its potential without a cohesive product strategy.

**Tactical advice:**
- Distinguish between 'fake' strategy and a 'real compelling, cohesive' strategy.
- Recognize that execution alone cannot fix a fundamental lack of strategic direction.

*Timestamp: 28:38*


## Stewart Butterfield
*Stewart Butterfield*

> "If you can't see almost limitless opportunities to improve, then you shouldn't be designing the product. ... I feel like what we have right now is just a giant piece of shit. It's just terrible and we should be humiliated that we offer this to the public."

**Insight:** A strong product vision is driven by a state of 'divine discontent' and a refusal to accept current versions as 'good enough.'

**Tactical advice:**
- Maintain a high bar for quality that views current versions as 'humiliating' compared to the potential
- Cultivate a perpetual desire for improvement across the design team

*Timestamp: 00:00:14*


## Shweta Shriva
*Shweta Shriva*

> "In terms of the product, whether you're working for a big company or a startup, the core product management tenant is still the same, which is, you have to work backwards from the customer problem or the user problem. Building a technology for the sake of it doesn't really go that far, so you really have to focus on the, what are you building, who are you building it for and what problem are you solving?"

**Insight:** A strong product vision is rooted in the specific problem being solved for a specific user, rather than the technology itself.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on the 'who' and the 'what problem' before the 'how' of the technology.

*Timestamp: 25:40*


## Tomer Cohen
*Tomer Cohen*

> "To really set the new purpose for it, which was this is not a springboard for other products, this is not a traffic jumpstart for, it's not an app self feed, it's really about people that matter talking about things that I care about professionally. It's about knowledge exchange."

**Insight:** A successful product turnaround requires redefining the core purpose and vision to move away from legacy behaviors.

**Tactical advice:**
- Shift product DNA from 'activity tracking' to 'value exchange' or 'knowledge sharing'.
- Define the vision by asking: 'If you're successful, what change would happen in the world?'

*Timestamp: 00:20:07*


## Vikrama Dhiman
*Vikrama Dhiman*

> "Product strategy for me is where you are able to define that while somebody defines that this is the mountain that you're going to climb, but okay, how are you going to climb that mountain is basically the product strategy piece."

**Insight:** Product strategy is the specific plan for how to achieve a set goal, focusing on user segments and sequencing.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on defining the 'how' of climbing the mountain once the 'what' (goal) is set
- Identify specific user segments and their needs to inform the strategy
- Determine the specific order of operations for product development

*Timestamp: 00:55:47*


## Vijay
*Vijay*

> "If you are the leader in some core product, our takeaway here is you should continue to out invests everyone else in that core and then invest the profits that come out of that core into the next venture. Invest profits and not people"

**Insight:** Protect your core product from disruption by reinvesting profits rather than diverting existing talent to new ventures.

**Tactical advice:**
- Avoid moving core team members to experimental secondary products
- Fund new ventures with profits or venture capital, not by thinning out the core engineering team

*Timestamp: 00:18*

---

> "This design driven initiative was really about how can we think about the system architecture of our product? What are the key building blocks of Mixpanel? Where do they need to fit? How few of them can we have, which is a really important step?"

**Insight:** A strong product vision is built on a robust system architecture and a minimal set of powerful building blocks.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the core building blocks of the product (e.g., pages and blocks in Notion)
- Optimize for the fewest number of building blocks possible to increase feature reach and consistency

*Timestamp: 10:53*


## Ebi Atawodi
*Ebi Atawodi*

> "four things. So it has to be lofty, it has to be realistic, it has to be devoid of any tech or limitations of today, and it has to be grounded in a very clear and potent problem. User problem."

**Insight:** A strong product vision must balance being aspirational with being attainable, while ignoring current technical constraints to focus on the core user problem.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ensure the vision is lofty enough to be exciting but realistic enough to feel reachable
- Remove technical limitations of today when imagining the future state
- Ground the vision in a potent user problem

*Timestamp: 00:07:57*

---

> "Once upon a time, write the problem and then write something and then write something, and then one day something happened. And as a result, the state of the world where we're trying to be. It's very simplistic, but in its simplicity of the magic because you are like, 'I'm a PM, I'm trying to solve problems.'"

**Insight:** Using a narrative 'Mad Libs' framework helps simplify complex product goals into a relatable story of change.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use the 'Once upon a time' framework: Once upon a time [problem], then one day [event/launch], and because of that [change], and finally [new state of the world]

*Timestamp: 00:16:12*

---

> "I write an article. I'll write in the headline because if the vision has come to pass, right? And it's gone well, someone's going to be writing hopefully some sexy headline about the thing that you've built. So I go to the future and I write the headline I would see. And I write the subtitle, just that, and I'll actually use the... I'll [inaudible 00:18:01] it into the page of TechCrunch or [inaudible 00:18:04] or something just so it looks realistic."

**Insight:** Visualizing the future through a mock news article or headline forces clarity on the ultimate impact and value proposition of the product.

**Tactical advice:**
- Write a future TechCrunch or New York Times headline and subtitle for your product
- Mock the headline into a realistic-looking news page to provoke a response and build conviction

*Timestamp: 00:17:54*

---

> "I actually took a screenshot of the Google Play Store... and then I created rounded rectangles, just blank rectangles, four panels. And then I printed that out and I gave everyone a sheet and I said, 'If we solve these problems... what would be the screenshots?'"

**Insight:** Mocking up the App Store presence forces the team to prioritize the 3-4 most important value propositions that will actually land with users.

**Tactical advice:**
- Print out blank App Store screenshot templates and have the team draw the 'hero mocks' and captions for the future product

*Timestamp: 00:25:00*


## Josh Miller
*Josh Miller*

> "we want to be to the web browser, what the iPhone was to the cell phone. Yes. The iPhone replaced your cell phone, but it really was something much more. And so, we want Arc to be the iPhone for the internet, and that yes, it replaces your default browser... it really is that interface, this new type of computer."

**Insight:** A powerful vision uses a 'Trojan Horse' strategy: replace a familiar utility (the browser) to eventually become a new computing paradigm (the internet computer).

**Tactical advice:**
- Use a well-known historical analogy (like the iPhone) to explain a complex future vision
- Frame the product as an interface to a macro trend (like the shift to cloud computing)

*Timestamp: 01:18:57*


## Nickey Skarstad
*Nickey Skarstad*

> "I really like the vision mission strategy pyramid... At the top is vision. Below it is mission and strategy, and then objectives. And this is a very simple framework... where do you need to go long term? In 10 years, if you could zoom up and look at what an ideal path for you would be, what is that? Write it down."

**Insight:** The Vision-Mission-Strategy-Objectives pyramid provides a clear hierarchy for translating long-term aspirations into daily work.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define a 10-year vision as the top level of abstraction
- Ensure each level of the pyramid (Mission, Strategy, Objectives) ladders up to the Vision

*Timestamp: 00:29:51*

---

> "I would pre-fill out the Miro beforehand... create them as headers in the Miro document... give everyone the space and the freedom to think existential and to frame it that way, 'we are going to be thinking in a five to 10 year timeline. Do not worry about what's happening today.'"

**Insight:** Effective visioning sessions require pre-structured environments that explicitly permit 'existential' thinking away from daily constraints.

**Tactical advice:**
- Pre-fill whiteboarding tools (Miro/FigJam) with headers and prompts before the meeting
- Use timers and music to facilitate focused, creative brainstorming
- Synthesize ideas into buckets after the meeting rather than forcing a final vision in the room

*Timestamp: 00:32:44*


## Peter Deng
*Peter Deng*

> "You have to plan your chess moves out in advance. You have to really think before you act and build systems that were going to let you go sustainably faster."

**Insight:** Scaling from 1 to 100 requires long-term systems thinking and planning several 'chess moves' ahead.

**Tactical advice:**
- Build scalable architectural systems (like Uber's 'Venues') to enable future speed
- Avoid 'spaghetti' solutions during hyperscale by pausing to re-architect core components

*Timestamp: 00:38:31*


## Sanchan Saxena
*Sanchan Saxena*

> "The thing that I learned from him was intentionality... You got to have intentionality. Where do you want to go? What is the world you want to create for your customers? And then create out A/B testing to get you the fastest route to that end state world."

**Insight:** Product vision should be driven by intentionality—defining the desired world first—rather than just reacting to A/B test results.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define the 'intentionality' of the product before setting up tests
- Use A/B testing as a GPS to find the fastest route to a pre-defined destination, not to choose the destination

*Timestamp: 00:32:57*

---

> "What Brian taught us was think unconstrained first. Think about a 15 out of 10 experience, design the ideal end state first. In most companies, the designers and PM start by saying, 'Okay, 10 is perfect. We can probably do seven. Let's start at seven.' It's a very constrained minded thinking."

**Insight:** Start the product design process by imagining a '15 out of 10' experience without any resource or technical constraints.

**Tactical advice:**
- Design the perfect, unconstrained experience first, then work backwards to what is feasible
- Do things that don't scale in one location to prove the 'lovable' product before scaling

*Timestamp: 00:34:31*


## Tamar Yehoshua
*Tamar Yehoshua*

> "In 2014, he wrote a master plan for Slack, which was build a product people love, build a network. That's Slack Connect. Build a platform that makes all of your other SaaS products more valuable. That's Slack Platform. And then do some magic AI stuff... It literally was. There was a grid with four boxes in 2014 and it never changed."

**Insight:** A great product vision is simple, long-term, and remains consistent even as specific tactics evolve over years.

*Timestamp: 00:30:17*


## Tobi Lutke
*Tobi Lutke*

> "I talk about look in the future and then think backwards a lot, right? It's like what would we want to have done 20 years ago on this? We have very long-term plans. At 100 years you can't talk about this software project but you can talk about the mission itself, whatever things that will survive for 80 years that are left on this particular timeframe."

**Insight:** A 100-year vision focuses on the enduring mission rather than specific software projects.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look decades into the future and work backwards to current decisions
- Focus the long-term vision on the mission (e.g., entrepreneurship) rather than the tool
- Ask: 'What is the decision our future selves would want us to make?'

*Timestamp: 01:01:11*

> "The positional game is like, what is the territory on the map that you are taking? What role do you play? How much trust do you have of merchants? Do merchants want more from you or less? Are you the kind of thing they're trying to optimize out of their software spend, or the one that they ask to subsume all other software spend? ... If you do that well, the tactics are yours."

**Insight:** Product leadership is a 'positional game' of building trust and territory, which makes future tactical wins easier.

**Tactical advice:**
- Prioritize the 'positional game' (trust, role, territory) over short-term 'tactics' (hacks, A/B tests)
- Avoid 'tacticking' yourself out of a position by over-extracting value from customers
- Focus on being the partner customers want to rely on more deeply over time

*Timestamp: 01:12:25*


## Jag Duggal
*Jag Duggal*

> "We're not trying to be incrementally better, we are trying to be fundamentally different."

**Insight:** Product vision should anchor in being fundamentally different, not incrementally better.

**Tactical advice:**
- Define vision around being different
- Use Amazon mock press release

*Timestamp: 00:00:10*
