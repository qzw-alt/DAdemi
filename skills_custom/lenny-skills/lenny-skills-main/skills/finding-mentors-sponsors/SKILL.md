# Finding Mentors & Sponsors

Help the user build meaningful mentor and sponsor relationships using approaches from 19 product leaders.

## How to Help

When the user asks for help finding mentors or sponsors:

1. **Clarify the goal** - Ask whether they need advice (mentor), advocacy and opportunities (sponsor), or accountability (coach). These are different relationships with different approaches
2. **Identify potential candidates** - Help them think about who is 2-3 years ahead on their desired path, who has solved their specific problem before, or who has organizational influence
3. **Design the approach** - Guide them toward small, specific asks rather than formal "will you be my mentor" requests
4. **Build the relationship** - Coach them on following up with results, offering reciprocal value, and maintaining the connection over time

## Core Principles

### Sponsors matter more than mentors for career acceleration
Christopher Miller: "Mentors are great... but I would actually describe those folks as being sponsors and advocates, people who were willing to put up capital, whether that's professional, social capital to bet on you." Differentiate between advice-givers (mentors) and opportunity-creators (sponsors). Build trust with potential sponsors by being coachable and delivering results on their behalf.

### Never formally ask someone to be your mentor
Gibson Biddle: "Don't ask a person to be your mentor. That's really awkward. First, identify them... then find ways to be helpful. Everybody needs help." Build mentorship relationships organically by offering value first rather than making a formal request.

### Start with the smallest possible ask
Jules Walter: "Make the smallest ask possible... 'Is there an example of product that you think was created with this approach?' Something he could answer in literally two minutes via email." Secure high-level mentors by starting with tiny, specific requests that require minimal effort, then build the relationship through follow-ups that show you applied their advice.

### Admit what you don't know
Chip Conley: "Brian would go to experts and say, 'I don't know what the hell I'm doing.'... I appreciated that a guy who had a lot of hubris could also have the humility to say, 'I want to learn more about this.'" The most effective way to learn from mentors is radical honesty about your knowledge gaps, regardless of your seniority.

### Build a stable of multiple mentors
Bangaly Kaba: "It's actually better to have a stable of mentors. You want to have three or four. And ideally, what you do is you meet with each one of them once a month on a different Friday." Schedule meetings with different mentors on different weeks. Ask for mentors by describing a specific challenge rather than requesting general mentorship.

### Ask "why" to extract frameworks, not just answers
Bret Taylor: "When you ask for advice, don't just ask what to do but why. Be an obnoxious two-year-old kid, why? Why? Why?" Deconstruct their advice into underlying frameworks to avoid misapplying their specific anecdotes to your different situation.

### Your problems are not unique
Elena Verna: "Don't think that you have unique problems. You don't... Your problem has been solved by somebody." Reach out to peers at other companies via LinkedIn or X to ask how they solved specific growth challenges. Hire advisors to provide structural frameworks for new initiatives.

### Mentorship can be a collection, not a single relationship
Ami Vora: "I had everything I needed, people were so kind and generous, but I didn't recognize it that way because we talk about it differently." Build "emulators" of different leaders in your head to load their specific skillsets. Don't feel pressured to find one perfect mentor who matches your exact life path.

### Use peer coaching circles for scalable support
Deb Liu: "I'm in a lean-in group and we support each other... coaching circles give you an opportunity to learn from each other and to get peer coaching." Join or form a coaching circle with peers at a similar career stage to share challenges and validate whether a problem is personal or situational.

### Study "dead or distant mentors"
Phyl Terry: "Warren Buffett is my mentor, he just doesn't know it... if you really study that moment and study what Jobs did, it can inform your decisions." Select a leader you respect and study their specific actions during critical career moments. Read primary sources rather than just biographies.

### Offer written questions as a low-friction option
Paul Millerd: "If we can't jump on a call, can I send you a list of questions?" When doing cold outreach, offer to send written questions instead of requesting a live call to increase response rates.

## Questions to Help Users

- "Are you looking for advice on a problem, or do you need someone to advocate for you and create opportunities?"
- "Who is 2-3 years ahead of you on the path you want to take?"
- "What specific problem or decision are you trying to get help with?"
- "Who in your organization has the influence to 'go to bat' for you?"
- "What value could you offer to potential mentors in return?"
- "Do you have anyone who holds you accountable to your goals?"

## Common Mistakes to Flag

- **Asking "Will you be my mentor?"** - This formal request is awkward and puts pressure on both parties. Build the relationship organically through specific asks
- **Seeking one perfect mentor** - No single person will match your exact path. Build a diverse stable of mentors with different strengths
- **Only asking for advice, never showing results** - Always circle back to show how you applied their guidance. This builds trust and maintains the relationship
- **Confusing mentorship with sponsorship** - Mentors give advice; sponsors bet their professional capital on you. Know which you need
- **Making big asks too early** - Start with questions that can be answered in two minutes via email before asking for calls or ongoing relationships
