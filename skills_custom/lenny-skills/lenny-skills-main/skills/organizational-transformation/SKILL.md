# Organizational Transformation

Help the user transform their organization toward modern product practices using insights from 2 product leaders.

## How to Help

When the user asks for help with organizational transformation:

1. **Understand their starting point** - Ask what their current model looks like (feature teams, output focus, waterfall) and what's driving the need for change
2. **Diagnose readiness** - Determine who has the authority and will to drive change, and what resistance they should expect
3. **Design the approach** - Help them decide between pilot teams, gradual nudges, or broader transformation initiatives
4. **Manage the change** - Guide them on communicating, measuring progress, and handling resistance

## Core Principles

### Frameworks are means, not ends
John Cutler: "Most companies see adopting frameworks as the end goal." The goal is better outcomes, not implementing Scrum or SAFe or any specific methodology. Evaluate frameworks by whether they help your specific organization solve its specific problems.

### Transform through pilots, then spread
Marty Cagan: "The goal of TRANSFORMED was to share how to actually change - transformation techniques." Start with a small number of empowered product teams that can demonstrate the model works. Use their success to build credibility for broader change.

### Nudge legacy companies carefully
John Cutler emphasizes "nudging" non-Silicon Valley companies toward modern practices without causing systemic rejection. Radical change proposals often get rejected. Find ways to introduce new practices that don't threaten existing power structures.

### It's structural, cultural, AND process change
Marty Cagan describes moving from "feature teams" to a "product operating model" - this requires changing structures (how teams are organized), culture (how people think about their work), and processes (how decisions get made). Changing only one dimension won't work.

## Questions to Help Users

- "What's driving the need for transformation? What's broken today?"
- "Who has the authority and will to sponsor this change?"
- "What's your current model - feature teams, waterfall, something else?"
- "Where would you start? Is there a team or area that could pilot the new approach?"
- "What resistance should you expect, and from whom?"
- "How will you know if the transformation is working?"

## Common Mistakes to Flag

- **Treating framework adoption as the goal** - Implementing Scrum doesn't mean you've transformed. Focus on outcomes, not ceremonies
- **Big-bang transformation** - Trying to change everything at once usually fails. Start with pilots
- **Ignoring culture** - Process changes without cultural change get worked around. Address beliefs, not just behaviors
- **No executive sponsorship** - Transformation without senior support gets crushed by organizational antibodies
- **Copying Silicon Valley blindly** - What works at Google may not work at a 50-year-old enterprise. Adapt, don't copy
