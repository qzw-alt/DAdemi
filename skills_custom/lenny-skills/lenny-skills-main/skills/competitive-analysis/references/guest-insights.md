> "We have assigned people into groups for the quarter to own a competitor. Their job is to essentially spend a lot of time immersing themselves into the product of the competitor, really trying to think through the lens of, do a SWAT analysis... then we have the competitive war gaming day where every team comes and presents."

**Insight:** Competitive 'War Gaming' distributes market research across the team, ensuring deep immersion into competitor products.

**Tactical advice:**
- Assign specific competitors to small groups for a full quarter.
- Conduct a SWOT analysis from the competitor's perspective.
- Host a 'War Gaming Day' for teams to present findings and earn prizes.

> "the first step in a good positioning exercise is to really understand, what do we have to position against? So put another way, it's like saying, what do I have to beat in order to win a deal? So in positioning work we call this competitive alternatives."

**Insight:** Positioning must begin by identifying the 'competitive alternatives'—what the customer would do if your product didn't exist.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify what you have to beat to win a deal
- Look beyond direct competitors to 'competitive alternatives'

> "Most folks will discount the status quo, but they shouldn't because in B2B we lose about 40% of our deals to quote-unquote, 'no decision,' which actually means we lost to the spreadsheet, we lost to pen and paper, we lost to interns. And if we're not positioning well against that, we're never going to get the customer to come off of that."

**Insight:** The status quo (spreadsheets, manual processes) is often the most significant competitor in B2B sales.

**Tactical advice:**
- Position specifically against the 'status quo' (e.g., spreadsheets or manual work)
- Address the 'no decision' risk by highlighting the cost of sticking with current processes

*Timestamp: 00:22:10*

> "What we should be doing is giving them a way to think about the whole market and say, in the case of Help Scout, 'Look, there's shared inbox and then there's help desk software and then there's us.' And I don't care who the vendor is, I'm going to put them in one of those buckets."

**Insight:** Competitive analysis should be used to categorize the market into 'approaches' rather than just listing competitors, helping the buyer simplify their decision-making process.

**Tactical advice:**
- Group competitors into buckets based on their fundamental approach to the problem.
- Acknowledge the strengths of other approaches for specific types of customers to build trust.
- Position your product as the only one that fits the 'perfect world' criteria you've established.

> "For a long time it was when someone says, 'Hey, why are you betting on Venmo?' I'd be like, 'Try and send me a dollar that I can use now,' and there was only one app you could do it with."

**Insight:** Identify a 'cut through the clutter' differentiator that clearly separates your product from the market leader.

**Tactical advice:**
- Find a specific functional gap in the competitor's product (e.g., speed of money movement).
- Use that gap as the primary narrative for why your product is the better choice.

> "When we talk about category, I think it's really what would be a good way to explore your space and your relevant categories would be to go to G2 Crowd or Software Advice or any of those type of review sites or directory sites and learn about how they've categorized products based on feature sets."

**Insight:** Review sites and directory platforms are primary tools for understanding how the market currently categorizes products and features.

**Tactical advice:**
- Analyze G2 Crowd and Software Advice to see existing product categorizations
- Study how competitors are grouped based on their feature sets

*Timestamp: 10:04*


## Boz
*Boz*

> "I can tell you from using it what instructions they were given, that team was given. I can tell you what they were optimizing for. I can tell you what constraints they were under."

**Insight:** True competitive analysis involves reverse-engineering a competitor's internal trade-offs and strategic constraints by using their product.

**Tactical advice:**
- Analyze a competitor's product to identify what they sacrificed (e.g., comfort vs. resolution).
- Evaluate whether a competitor's 'breakthrough' is a fundamental shift or a linear scaling advantage.

*Timestamp: 01:09:39*


## Bret Taylor
*Bret Taylor*

> "Why use this instead of Yahoo Yellow Pages? But more than anything else, why use this instead of the Yellow Pages?"

**Insight:** Competitive analysis should include the 'analog' or non-consumption alternative, not just direct digital competitors.

**Tactical advice:**
- Compare your product against the traditional, non-digital way users solve the problem

*Timestamp: 00:06:54*

> "Twitter had the fail whale and it was down half the time... our product, we were innovating faster... and we totally lost for no reason related to product at all."

**Insight:** Technical superiority and uptime are not enough to win if the competitor has better market momentum or distribution.

**Tactical advice:**
- Analyze competitors' distribution moats, not just their feature sets

*Timestamp: 00:26:00*


## Chandra Janakiraman
*Chandra Janakiraman*

> "The idea is you try to understand who are the comparables or the competitors in the space, and you sort of build a little bit of a head-to-head and sort a stack chart of where's everybody going..."

**Insight:** Competitive analysis should focus on inferring competitor strategies based on their explicit feature releases.

**Tactical advice:**
- Build head-to-head stack charts to visualize competitor investment areas
- Analyze adjacent roadmaps within your own company to identify potential rub-off effects

*Timestamp: 00:25:59*


## Chris Hutchins
*Chris Hutchins*

> "understanding what's happening outside of the walls of our business better than a lot of people. And maybe that's talking to a lot of other people who are founders talking to a lot of other people, starting companies, going to read all the comments on new financial products on Product Hunt."

**Insight:** Deep market awareness comes from engaging with external founder communities and monitoring public feedback on new products.

**Tactical advice:**
- Read user comments on competitor launches on platforms like Product Hunt
- Maintain a network of external founders to stay informed on industry trends

*Timestamp: 00:15:14*


## Christopher Lochhead
*Christopher Lochhead*

> "Category designers do compete, but not against a product, not against a company, not against a brand. Category designers compete against the status quo. ... The enemy is the status quo. That is to say the way it is now."

**Insight:** True innovation competes against the old way of doing things, not specific rival companies.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the 'status quo' your product is replacing and frame it as the enemy.
- Use 'Damming the Demand' to redirect customers from the old category to your new one.

*Timestamp: 01:19:34*


## David Placek
*David Placek*

> "We call that developing a landscape. And we're looking for what are the words... What are the brand names, first, and then what language are they using in this space? Because we have to be distinctive. If a brand name isn't distinctive, you lose."

**Insight:** Effective naming requires mapping the existing linguistic and brand landscape to ensure differentiation.

**Tactical advice:**
- Analyze the specific language and naming conventions used by competitors to find 'white space'

*Timestamp: 00:20:11*


## Dan Hockenmaier
*Dan Hockenmaier*

> "At Thumbtack example, we had a spreadsheet which tracked hundreds of verticalized competitors where somebody would try to pick off the electricians category, the wedding category, the lessons category, and very few of them got traction for the simple reason that we could upsell customers into a thousand things."

**Insight:** Horizontal marketplaces often beat vertical competitors because their higher customer LTV (from cross-selling) allows them to outspend on acquisition.

**Tactical advice:**
- Compare your LTV against vertical competitors to determine if you can outbid them on shared acquisition channels like SEM

*Timestamp: 00:51:48*


## Daniel Lereya
*Daniel Lereya*

> "Use your competition, know it, and take it, and set ambitious goals, and believe in yourself, and you can do amazing things."

**Insight:** View competitor progress as a 'gift' that proves what is possible, using it to benchmark and set more ambitious internal goals.

**Tactical advice:**
- Analyze competitor feature velocity to identify internal execution gaps
- Use competitor launches to invalidate internal excuses about technical impossibility

*Timestamp: 00:01:06*


## Dalton Caldwell
*Dalton Caldwell*

> "My suggestion was to start by looking at what companies are publicly traded and/or owned by private equity that are large and that also are hated by their customers, and to try to intentionally find where there's a knowable big market within incumbent combined with the software is horrible."

**Insight:** A high-probability startup strategy is identifying large, successful incumbents with low customer satisfaction (low NPS) and building a modern alternative.

**Tactical advice:**
- Analyze publicly traded or PE-owned companies for low customer satisfaction
- Target markets where the incumbent software is 'horrible' but the market is proven and large

*Timestamp: 00:19:18*


## Drew Houston
*Drew Houston*

> "The press often writes about competition like, 'Oh, it's a shotgun blast.' When, later, I would learn it's more of a boa constrictor."

**Insight:** Incumbent competition is rarely a single destructive event; it is a slow, tightening pressure through bundling and constant iteration.

**Tactical advice:**
- Watch for 'mushroom cloud' moments (major competitor announcements) but focus on the long-term impact of bundling.
- Recognize that the impact of a competitor's launch often has a significant time lag before it shows in the numbers.

*Timestamp: 00:16:06*


## Elena Verna
*Elena Verna 3.0*

> "Knowing what your competition is doing is extremely important... But blatantly saying, 'Hey, we're going to copy all of these best tactics or all of these flows because, hey, they're doing better than us. Let's just rip them and do exactly the same.' That's where things really go wrong because every single experience is very unique to their customer, to their channel."

**Insight:** Use competitors for inspiration and pattern recognition, but avoid blindly copying their flows as they may be unoptimized or context-specific.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use web archives to analyze how competitor pricing or landing pages have changed over time to extrapolate what worked.
- Identify common elements across multiple successful competitors to find 'winning' industry patterns.
- Never skip the ideation, user research, and experimentation steps just because a competitor uses a certain feature.

*Timestamp: 00:25:13*


## Gibson Biddle
*Gibson Biddle*

> "What makes Netflix hard to copy? ... Original content ... Brand ... Personalization ... Economies of scale ... Network effects."

**Insight:** True differentiation comes from building 'hard to copy' advantages like brand trust, unique technology, and scale rather than just matching features.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify which of the four 'hard to copy' buckets your product fits into: Brand, Network Effects, Economies of Scale, or Unique Technology
- Invest in personalization to create a data-driven moat that competitors cannot easily replicate

*Timestamp: 15:18*


## Hamilton Helmer
*Hamilton Helmer*

> "Understanding whether or not there is a type of power in place is hard... It comes down to the hard part is industry economics is what really are the economic relationships and it's very hard."

**Insight:** True competitive advantage is difficult to identify and requires a deep understanding of the underlying industry economics rather than surface-level observations.

**Tactical advice:**
- Analyze the specific economic relationships in your industry to determine if a perceived advantage is actually a durable power.

*Timestamp: 00:22:47*

---

> "People often think that they get scale economies through data. And I'd say that that's possible, but it's rare. And the reason it's rare is not because there aren't scale economies in data, but rather that the range of scale that the existing competitors have are often large enough to be able to put them in shouting distance of each so that the differences in their cost per unit is not that great."

**Insight:** Data-based scale economies are often illusory because the competitive advantage diminishes once competitors reach a certain threshold of data.

**Tactical advice:**
- Check if your data advantage actually creates a material cost or price difference that competitors cannot bridge.

*Timestamp: 00:23:50*

---

> "Netflix in an earlier phase was fighting Blockbuster... If you look at the Blockbuster site, their UI site, you couldn't tell it different from Netflix. They just copied it. And so all that thoughtfulness about which things you put first and how you structure it and all that to make this suitable was mimicable."

**Insight:** Operational excellence and user interface design are often mimicable and therefore do not constitute a durable competitive barrier (moat).

**Tactical advice:**
- Distinguish between 'castle' features (durable power) and 'shack' features (easily copied UI/UX) when assessing your competitive position.

*Timestamp: 00:32:31*


## Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky
*Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky 2.0*

> "What's the competition for solving that problem? How do they solve it today? And what are the alternatives? How else do people solve this? What are the workarounds?"

**Insight:** Competition includes not just direct competitors, but any workaround or alternative the customer currently uses to solve the problem.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look beyond direct startup competitors to manual workarounds or existing habits.
- Identify how customers are currently dealing with the problem today.

*Timestamp: 00:15:04*

---

> "We want to have a way of looking at the world that puts all of the competitors into Loserville. And then we want to say, okay, if you can deliver on that and if that promise is compelling to customers."

**Insight:** A successful competitive analysis identifies a unique quadrant (the top-right) where the product wins, leaving all other alternatives in an 'L-shaped' area of inferiority.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a 2x2 differentiation chart.
- Plot competitors to ensure they fall into 'Loserville' (the other three quadrants) relative to your unique value proposition.

*Timestamp: 00:33:29*


## Jessica Hische
*Jessica Hische*

> "I mean, everybody that does branding, one of the things that they do is they analyze the competitors of the company. You just look at a landscape of what are all the competitors doing, what is their visual vibe, and do I lean into that or do I avoid that? If I lean into it, then I'm immediately getting this... Everyone that looks at it understands I'm a FinTech company because I look like a FinTech company. If my whole thing is I'm trying to be divergent from that, I'm trying to show how different I am from the status quo, then you use it as a reactionary thing of I want to do nothing like that and do something really different so people understand this isn't just another FinTech company."

**Insight:** Brand design should be a conscious choice between leaning into industry tropes for immediate category recognition or diverging to signal innovation.

**Tactical advice:**
- Map the visual landscape of competitors to decide whether to align with or react against industry standards.
- Use industry-standard colors (like green for FinTech) if you want instant category association, or avoid them to signal divergence.

*Timestamp: 00:32:10*


## Judd Antin
*Judd Antin*

> "Macro research is big picture, strategic, business focused, forward-looking innovation, look at the market, look at competitors, long-term research to understand where the product should go next."

**Insight:** Macro research should focus on the competitive landscape and long-term market opportunities to drive strategic planning.

**Tactical advice:**
- Conduct TAM (Total Addressable Market) studies and competitive reports.
- Align macro research projects with annual or multi-year planning cycles.

*Timestamp: 00:09:20*


## Julia Schottenstein
*Julia Schottenstein*

> "We really have three pillars when it comes to competition. So the first is hold true to our vision... The second philosophy we have is really a grow the pie philosophy... And then the last one is we want to lean into our strengths."

**Insight:** Effective competition involves ignoring external noise to focus on vision, expanding the market through partnerships, and doubling down on unique platform strengths.

**Tactical advice:**
- Ignore 'shade' or criticism from competitors and focus on running your own race.
- Look for ways to partner with ecosystem players to grow the total addressable market rather than fighting over small slices.
- Identify specific standards (like transformation or semantic layers) where you must hold your ground.

*Timestamp: 00:18:15*


## Kayvon Beykpour
*Kayvon Beykpour*

> "I think it's always about doing the right thing for the customer. Everyone has always been shameless to be shamelessly inspired by other people's ideas. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think copying ideas can be done in poor taste and can be done with taste."

**Insight:** Copying features from competitors is acceptable if done with 'taste' and focused on customer needs.

**Tactical advice:**
- When inspired by a competitor, identify the 'shortcuts' they found to make an experience work, then apply your own unique spin.

*Timestamp: 01:12:30*


## Logan Kilpatrick
*Logan Kilpatrick*

> "I think where you start to get into some of these very vertical applications... our models are probably never going to be as capable as some of the things that Harvey's doing because our goal and our mission is really to solve this very general use case."

**Insight:** To avoid direct competition with OpenAI, builders should focus on vertical, domain-specific applications rather than general-purpose assistants.

**Tactical advice:**
- Build products with domain-specific knowledge (e.g., legal, sales) that require custom UI and fine-tuning.
- Avoid building 'general purpose agents' unless the interface is radically different from ChatGPT.

*Timestamp: 00:11:17*


## Maggie Crowley
*Maggie Crowley*

> "In that section I put in what's going on with our business? What's happening with our products? What's our point of view on the market? Who are our competitors? A SWOT analysis, key risks that we might be facing."

**Insight:** Strategy requires a deep, documented understanding of the market landscape and competitor positioning.

**Tactical advice:**
- Include screenshots of competitor marketing websites in strategy docs
- Perform a SWOT analysis relative to the current market
- Identify unique competitive advantages where your team can win

*Timestamp: 00:36:44*


## Marty Cagan
*Marty Cagan*

> "The fourth area is you have to know the competitive landscape. You have to know the industry. You have to know the trends. I consider this one of the fun ones. There's some good industry, people to follow. You can do that."

**Insight:** A PM must be an expert on market trends and the competitive landscape to inform product direction.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify and follow key industry thought leaders
- Monitor competitor moves and broader industry trends regularly

*Timestamp: 00:41:33*


## Melanie Perkins
*Melanie Perkins*

> "And then they'd say, 'You're the same as some of other company.' And I would say, 'Hey, now I've got a new slide in my pitch deck that shows all the players and the huge gap in the market that we believe we're going to fill.'"

**Insight:** Use investor rejection to identify and visually articulate the specific market gap that competitors are missing.

**Tactical advice:**
- Create a dedicated slide in the pitch deck that maps out all current players
- Explicitly highlight the 'huge gap' in the market your product fills compared to incumbents

*Timestamp: 00:00:06*

---

> "One of the most important things that we did was we didn't really worry about competitors at all. We actually just saw where is there a gap in the market that we can uniquely fill, and what can we solve a problem, a core problem that people currently have today?"

**Insight:** Focus on unsolved customer pain points rather than reacting to competitor features to find a unique market entry point.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify gaps in the market by looking for problems that existing tools don't solve for specific user groups

*Timestamp: 00:50:38*


## Melissa Perri
*Melissa*

> "Go have a conversation with sales and see why people were buying competitors? What was your win-loss analysis? Why are we losing? What do you think is the issue?"

**Insight:** Sales teams are a primary source of competitive intelligence and can provide direct insights into why the market prefers other solutions.

**Tactical advice:**
- Conduct regular win-loss analysis meetings with the sales department.
- Analyze how competitors are positioned to identify opportunities for differentiation in your own vision.

*Timestamp: 40:08*


## Mike Krieger
*Mike Krieger*

> "How do we figure out what we want to be when we grow up versus what we currently aren't or wish that we were or see other players in the space being... I think there's room for several generationally important companies to be built in AI right now."

**Insight:** Differentiate by leaning into your unique strengths and 'personality' rather than trying to beat a dominant incumbent at their own game.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the specific user segments (e.g., 'builders' or 'makers') that resonate most with your brand.
- Avoid chasing the 'lightning in a bottle' consumer viral hits of competitors if it doesn't align with your core capabilities.

*Timestamp: 00:45:29*


## Mike Maples Jr
*Mike Maples Jr*

> "The great startups, they create movements not so much by criticizing the incumbent, but by showing the weakness in the strength of the incumbent."

**Insight:** Analyze incumbents to find where their greatest strength becomes a liability in a new context.

**Tactical advice:**
- Map out the incumbent's core value proposition
- Identify how that value proposition limits them from serving a new, emerging need

*Timestamp: 01:11:31*


## Nikita Miller
*Nikita Miller*

> "I think that having a good pulse on competition helps as just a friendly reminder that there are others out there doing this and thinking about things very similarly, possibly, to how we're thinking about it, so how do we differentiate ourselves?"

**Insight:** Competitive awareness serves as a driver for internal urgency and differentiation.

**Tactical advice:**
- Maintain a pulse on competitors to prevent complacency
- Use competitor progress as a benchmark for your own team's shipping velocity

*Timestamp: 28:39*


## Nikita Bier
*Nikita Bier*

> "I looked on the App Store and the number one app in the United States was an app called Sarahah, but the entire app was in Arabic... the strongest signal that you could ever have that people want something."

**Insight:** Extreme friction in a popular product (like a foreign language) is a powerful signal of massive underlying demand.

**Tactical advice:**
- Monitor the App Store charts for apps with high rankings despite poor localized user experiences

*Timestamp: 00:00:15*


## Patrick Campbell
*Patrick Campbell*

> "Don't focus on your competitors is terrible advice. It's amazing advice for product teams... But as an overall missive, don't focus on your competitors is terrible advice. And if I'm being charitable, it's just outdated."

**Insight:** In modern, dense markets with high CAC, competitive intelligence is necessary for strategic positioning, even if it shouldn't dictate the product roadmap.

**Tactical advice:**
- Run white-label NPS and customer development surveys on your competitors' customers
- Create honest comparison pages if you are a market challenger
- Maintain a network of 'sources' (customers of competitors) to understand why they haven't switched

*Timestamp: 00:48:02*


## Richard Rumelt
*Richard Rumelt*

> "In a competitive situation, the fundamental aspect of power is something that's going to give you some sort of advantage. Usually it's in asymmetry of some kind. If two fighters are equally balanced... it's 50/50. For a strategy you need to exploit in asymmetry of some kind."

**Insight:** Competitive strategy requires identifying and exploiting an asymmetry—something you have or know that others do not.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify asymmetries in your team, knowledge, or resources compared to competitors.
- Look for 'value denial'—what should customers be able to buy but can't?

*Timestamp: 00:28:40*


## Roger Martin
*Roger Martin*

> "You have to be either differentiated or low cost, there's no way to protect yourself if you're not one of those two."

**Insight:** Sustainable competitive advantage is only possible through either cost leadership or a differentiated offering; anything else leaves a company vulnerable.

**Tactical advice:**
- Evaluate if your product is a 'coin flip' for customers; if so, you lack a winning strategy.
- Choose a path: either build the scale for low cost or the uniqueness for differentiation.

*Timestamp: 00:27:02*

---

> "The ultimate way to compete to win is to never actually be forced to compete."

**Insight:** The strongest strategies create such a unique set of capabilities and management systems that competitors find it too difficult or painful to follow.

**Tactical advice:**
- Look for 'fault lines' where a competitor's existing business model prevents them from copying you (counter-positioning).
- Build multifaceted capabilities that are harder to replicate than a single asset like a factory or a feature.

*Timestamp: 01:02:38*


## Robby Stein
*Robby Stein*

> "Not every great thing is going to be invented by you... At the end of the day, you're just robbing your user base of the opportunity to have a better product if you're not making the best possible product for your use cases."

**Insight:** Successful products adopt successful industry formats (like Feeds or Stories) and adapt them to their specific user expectations.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify existential threats where a competitor has found a better format for your core 'job'.
- Don't just copy; adapt the format to your product's unique primitives and user mental models.

*Timestamp: 00:31:25*


## Sarah Tavel
*Sarah Tavel*

> "I actually think that the most interesting markets, you have to think of them like currents where you're there's something happening in the market that's creating this current where you can have a plank of wood that you've put on the river and it's going to pull you forward. Versus a market that doesn't really have that momentum to it, you're going to have to build something really big and fancy to make any progress."

**Insight:** Market selection should focus on 'currents' (momentum and change) rather than just static market size.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify the 'why now' or the dynamics of change that will provide tailwinds for the product

*Timestamp: 00:00:00*

---

> "The more dominant a marketplace is relative to the number two in its space, the more profitable that business is... you don't want to be in the middle of the pack, but even being number one but just barely number one doesn't give you any of the benefits of a marketplace model."

**Insight:** Marketplace profitability is directly tied to relative market share dominance over the nearest competitor.

**Tactical advice:**
- Analyze the gap between your platform and the 'number two' player to assess long-term margin potential

*Timestamp: 00:44:10*


## Seth Godin
*Seth Godin*

> "Who's your competition? Because if you're competing against Walmart, why are you surprised that they keep lowering their prices? That's what Walmart does, right? That way you decide which space that you're going to operate in. You've built an enormous set of boundaries around what you do."

**Insight:** Choosing your competitors defines the constraints and rules of the market you must play by.

**Tactical advice:**
- Analyze the core strengths of competitors to understand the 'boundaries' of the market space you are entering.
- Choose a competitive space where your product's unique value proposition isn't undermined by the competitor's fundamental business model.

*Timestamp: 25:36*


## Shaun Clowes
*Shaun Clowes*

> "In everything always talk from the customer's perspective, from the market's perspective, from the competitor's perspective, the very small number of PMs do that."

**Insight:** Great product managers differentiate themselves by consistently grounding their work in external market and competitor realities rather than internal politics.

**Tactical advice:**
- Start every document from the perspective of the customer, market, or competitor.

*Timestamp: 00:00:26*

---

> "You can copy and paste one of your competitor's positioning documents into ChatGPT and say, 'Is this a better fit for what they have said than my thing?'"

**Insight:** LLMs can be used to stress-test your strategy against competitor positioning to find gaps or areas where they might have a better fit.

**Tactical advice:**
- Use LLMs to summarize competitor public documents to reverse-engineer their likely product strategy.
- Ask AI to find where a competitor's strategy might be more compelling to a customer than your own.

*Timestamp: 00:15:40*

---

> "It's the years and years and years of evolution of the underlying workflows of the product to support the customers, but also the customers evolving those workflows to make them work the way they do. And so how does that impact AI companies? You could say, 'It's easier than ever to build forms on a database application.' And so I'm like, 'Yeah, okay, that presumably drives the incremental value of every new one of those to zero, right?'"

**Insight:** True competitive advantage in SaaS comes from embedded business rules and workflows that create deep lock-in, which is harder to clone than simple UI or data models.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on building proprietary business rules and workflows that reflect the specific processes of your customers to increase switching costs.

*Timestamp: 00:25:45*


## Tanguy Crusson
*Tanguy Crusson*

> "Competitive myopia, don't fall for it... your competitor, if you think of what they do as an iceberg, the top side, what comes out of the water is what they've shipped in terms of features, but it's based on all this stuff that they've built in terms of research and understanding of their customer base and everything else. And so you're just seeing the manifestation of what they were thinking maybe a year ago, based on what they're shipping now."

**Insight:** Avoid 'fast-following' competitors because you only see their past output, not the underlying research and strategy.

**Tactical advice:**
- Limit competitive monitoring to once every three months to avoid reactive decision-making
- Anchor the team back in your own user interviews when a competitor makes a big announcement

*Timestamp: 00:28:26*


## Tom Conrad
*Tom Conrad*

> "We had this idea that we're going to reinvent radio... and Spotify and Rdio and Apple Music... they were all going to chase this smaller owned recorded music opportunity... and I think we just got it wrong. It should have been obvious that inevitably all of your music in any format was going to be delivered as a stream from the cloud."

**Insight:** Failing to recognize a fundamental shift in consumer behavior or industry licensing can lead to strategic obsolescence despite early success.

**Tactical advice:**
- Analyze whether your product category is being subsumed by a larger, adjacent trend
- Evaluate if your licensing or business model is compatible with the long-term preferences of industry incumbents

*Timestamp: 00:50:17*


## Tim Holley
*Tim Holley*

> "bringing an outside in perspective, really benchmarking against your competitors and your competitive set... our buyers are shopping all over the internet. They're shopping on High Street, they're shopping in different places. And so we have to be aware of the broader context of where they're spending their dollars helps us make better decisions over time."

**Insight:** Benchmarking against the broader market, even without a direct one-to-one competitor, grounds product decisions in actual buyer behavior.

**Tactical advice:**
- Benchmark against the broader context of where customers spend money, not just direct competitors.
- Use 'outside-in' perspectives to challenge internal assumptions about uniqueness.

*Timestamp: 00:10:32*


## Uri Levine
*Uri Levine 2.0*

> "When iPhone was introduced, Microsoft basically say this will never work. They were in a position of a market leader, they own Windows mobile operating system that was running on pretty much all the phones in the world... They haven't realized how impactful it is. So this is a competition coming out to the market with something that is completely different. And not only disrupt the market but actually create crisis for pretty much everyone else."

**Insight:** Market leaders often fail to recognize the disruptive potential of new competitors that offer a fundamentally different user experience.

**Tactical advice:**
- Evaluate competitors not just on features, but on how they might fundamentally change user expectations (e.g., touchscreens vs. keypads).

> "Waze was focusing on the daily commuters. So we wanted people to use our application twice a day, when you go to the office and when you come back home. And Google Maps is something that you are being used not that frequent... So a different use case and obviously different product that is built for the specificity of the use case."

**Insight:** Differentiating from a dominant competitor requires focusing on a specific, high-frequency use case that the competitor's general-purpose tool doesn't serve as well.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify a specific use case (like daily commuting) to differentiate from a broader market incumbent.
- Build product features specifically for the frequency and context of that chosen use case.

> "Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, has this amazing quote. He says, 'Fish where the fish are.' And he gives this example, he says, 'If you're a fisherman and you see a large pond and all around the pond, there's a whole bunch of fishermen and they're all elbowing each other out of the way... You actually want to walk off into the forest and find a small fishing hole with lots of fish and very little competition.'"

**Insight:** The most profitable businesses are often found in unglamorous niches where high demand exists but competition is low, preserving margins.

**Tactical advice:**
- Avoid 'flashy' businesses like restaurants or cafes where competition is hyper-saturated.
- Look for 'boring' niches like pest control, funeral homes, or government form-filling software.
- Identify markets where you can be a 'big fish' in a small pond rather than competing with 'commercial fishermen' in large markets.

> "The biggest mistakes I've made have been going into business models where other people have repeatedly failed and thinking, I can do this better... you can't take a brilliant management team and change a bad business model. Ultimately the business model wins."

**Insight:** A space littered with 'dead bodies' (failed startups) usually indicates a fundamentally flawed business model that even great execution cannot fix.

**Tactical advice:**
- Research the history of a business model to see if others have repeatedly failed.
- Don't assume your management talent can overcome a structurally poor industry (e.g., local news or low-margin retail).
- Prioritize the business model over the team's brilliance.

> "With AI, it's just intensified because you have 10 players pursuing the same market opportunity and so your ability to actually bring the product to market to differentiate yourself from the competition has become more strategically important than it was previously."

**Insight:** AI has increased market saturation, making competitive differentiation a critical strategic priority.

**Tactical advice:**
- Focus on how you are better than competitors rather than just the pain point you solve.

> "The attributes of that business and that product category mean, you have to win on how much do people love your product and feel an emotional connection to it, and choose your brand, your product over the other, almost not rationally, but emotionally... In many ways it's capitalistic. This is how we win this market"

**Insight:** In commoditized markets where products are functionally similar, the primary competitive advantage is emotional connection and brand affinity.

**Tactical advice:**
- Identify if your category is a 'commodity' market where brand is the only differentiator
- Optimize for 'feelings' (joy, surprise, speed) to create non-rational loyalty

> "I don't think we've ever had this sense of arrogance of just... no matter how big we are, we've always got this healthy dose of paranoia that we need to keep working on improving things and being better."

**Insight:** Maintain a 'healthy paranoia' to stay ahead of competitors by obsessing over customer feedback and emerging technology.

**Tactical advice:**
- Distribute a random selection of raw customer feedback to the entire company weekly
- Run internal hackathons to foster innovation and explore new technologies
- Carve off small, dedicated teams to explore disruptive shifts like AI before they become mainstream

> "The thing I would say is bring the insight. Know thy customer. Know thy market. Know thy competitors. Know thy numbers. Know thy product."

**Insight:** To build trust with more experienced stakeholders, bring deep insights about the market and competitors rather than relying on functional expertise.

**Tactical advice:**
- Research the market and competitors to bring unique insights to meetings.
- Focus on knowing the product and customer numbers better than anyone else in the room.

> "Using this type of lens is an effective way to identify genuine threats... not just necessarily just everyone, generic people... identifying genuine threats, not that just, this data can be used to gain comprehensive insights like determining your position and impression share."

**Insight:** Use Auction Insights and 'true competition metrics' to distinguish between accidental keyword overlaps and intentional competitor conquesting.

**Tactical advice:**
- Monitor 'position above rate' and 'outranking share' to identify genuine competitive threats
- File trademark claims with Google if competitors use your brand name in their ad copy
- Distinguish between 'ego marketing' (wanting to be #1) and 'click share' (reaching the right person)

> "Every single day, every single time somebody is pushing your code to production and you're releasing a feature or an enhancement, you are making the product better or you're making the product worse, but the products never remain same. So with every release that your competitor is making and every release that you're making, you are either making chess points, moves against them, positive points, or you're going negative."

**Insight:** View product development as a zero-sum game of 'chess points' against competitors where every release either increases or decreases your relative standing.

**Tactical advice:**
- Evaluate every feature release based on whether it moves you ahead of or behind the competition in the customer's mind.
- Recognize that products never remain static; they are constantly being compared to the evolving market.

> "The success of a company is a direct relation of what the competition allows you to do. I feel like not many people talk about that, but in many cases in my professional career... every single instance when I looked at a company accelerated their growth or there was a deceleration of growth, it was a direct relation to what the competition allowed you to do."

**Insight:** A company's growth trajectory is often capped or enabled by the strength and distribution of its competitors.

**Tactical advice:**
- Analyze competition across three dimensions: solution quality, distribution outreach, and pricing/packaging.
- Identify your unique place in the tech ecosystem to ensure customers understand your specific value relative to incumbents.
