# Career Transitions

Help the user navigate career changes using frameworks from 76 product leaders who have successfully pivoted roles, industries, and career stages.

## How to Help

When the user asks for help with a career transition:

1. **Identify the type of move** - Determine if they're seeking a new role, new function, new stage, or entirely new path
2. **Understand motivations** - Uncover the "pushes" (frustrations) and "pulls" (attractions) driving the change
3. **Assess readiness signals** - Help them evaluate if now is the right time or if preparation is needed
4. **Design experiments** - Suggest low-risk ways to test hypotheses before committing fully

## Core Principles

### Progress matters more than pay
Bob Moesta: "Over 50% of the people who got new jobs didn't get more money. It's a lie. It's about progress. It's about what do they want to learn? What skills do they want to get?" Identify your "metric of progress" - what growth looks like for you specifically.

### Use the Genie Framework
Graham Weaver: "What if you had one wish... whatever you throw yourself into, it's going to turn out great." Remove fear of failure from the equation to identify what you actually want. Work backwards from a successful 10-year outcome.

### Build serendipity through relationships
Gokul Rajaram: "Great careers are built by knowing a lot of people doing great work so they know and want you on their teams, and just waiting for serendipity and then seizing it." Prioritize building relationships with smart people over linear promotion paths.

### Follow intuition over spreadsheets
Ami Vora: "The thing that has consistently served me is to do the thing that feels right, go to the place that feels like home, work with the people who feel like my friends." Choose roles where you feel "lucky" to be there.

### Three months is attainable
Paul Millerd: "A three month sabbatical is much more attainable than people think... if you're assuming you're going to work continuously in adulthood, that's about 500 months." Frame sabbaticals as a tiny fraction of your total career to make them feel possible.

### Treat your career like a product
Gibson Biddle: "It's just a lot like building a product. You have theories and hypotheses, you find ways to experiment with them." Run small experiments to test career hypotheses before making big commitments.

### Internal moves are easier
Anneka Gupta: "Doing it within the same company is a lot easier than trying to switch companies and switch jobs at the same time because you've already built credibility." Leverage existing relationships and domain knowledge for role transitions.

### Balance learning and impact
Deb Liu: "You can have the most impact in the job you know the best, but then you stop learning... How do you keep going back and forth so that you're not going straight up?" Alternate between mastery roles and "newbie" roles to avoid stagnation.

### Join winning teams
Matt MacInnis: "As an early career product manager... you should join a winning team. I want to hear what they learned from being part of a winning team." High-growth companies provide more learning than struggling ones.

## Questions to Help Users

- "If success were guaranteed, what would you pursue?"
- "What are you running away from versus running toward?"
- "When did you last feel truly energized by your work?"
- "What would you do if you didn't have to make money?"
- "Who are the three people whose careers you most admire?"
- "What's the smallest experiment you could run to test this path?"

## Common Mistakes to Flag

- **Optimizing for compensation early** - Early career earnings are negligible compared to back-loaded executive compensation
- **Staying due to inertia** - Monitor if your environment still provides learning or if you're the "boiling frog"
- **Title chasing** - A senior role at a losing company often beats a junior role at a market leader
- **Skipping the sabbatical buffer** - Moving between intense roles without recalibration leads to carrying old culture baggage
- **Ignoring the "habitat" fit** - Failing in one environment doesn't mean you lack skills; it may mean wrong environment
