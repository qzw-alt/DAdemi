# Product-Led Sales

Help the user implement product-led sales motions using frameworks from 2 product leaders.

## How to Help

When the user asks for help with product-led sales:

1. **Understand the current state** - Ask about their existing PLG motion and sales infrastructure
2. **Define the trigger criteria** - Help them identify what signals indicate a user is ready for sales outreach
3. **Design the handoff** - Create smooth transitions from self-serve to sales-assisted
4. **Align incentives** - Ensure product and sales teams are working toward the same goals

## Core Principles

### PLS converts usage into sales opportunities
Elena Verna: "Product-led sales converts the usage that you've generated via self-serve into a sales opportunity and it attaches a salesperson to close a much larger contract." PLS is a distinct motion that sits between PLG and traditional sales, using product usage data to identify and prioritize sales opportunities.

### Use data signals for outreach
Hila Qu: "How the product led funnel work for us is... our sales team get that data signal, they may send an email and reach out and say, 'Hey, I saw you were checking it out. How can I help?'" Product usage signals should trigger personalized sales outreach, not generic sequences.

### Define Product Qualified Accounts (PQAs)
Product-led sales requires new metrics like PQAs and PQLs (Product Qualified Leads) that measure product engagement rather than marketing engagement. These signals are more predictive of conversion than traditional MQLs.

### Sales should help, not sell
The initial sales outreach in a PLS motion should offer assistance based on observed behavior, not push for an immediate sale. The user has already experienced the product - sales adds value by solving specific expansion needs.

### Know when to transition
There's a natural ceiling for self-serve revenue (typically $10K-$15K). Product-led sales helps capture the value of users who need contracts larger than what credit cards support.

## Questions to Help Users

- "What user behaviors in your product correlate most strongly with eventual conversion to paid?"
- "At what usage level do users typically need capabilities beyond your self-serve tier?"
- "How will your sales team know which users to prioritize for outreach?"
- "What does your sales team say that adds value beyond what users can do self-serve?"
- "How do you prevent sales outreach from feeling intrusive to users who prefer self-serve?"

## Common Mistakes to Flag

- **Treating PLS like traditional sales** - Using high-pressure tactics with users who already have product experience
- **No clear trigger criteria** - Reaching out to all active users instead of those showing expansion signals
- **Sales and product misalignment** - Sales team incentivized on behaviors that conflict with product growth
- **Generic outreach** - Not personalizing based on actual product usage data
- **Ignoring the self-serve path** - Forcing users into sales when they'd convert faster on their own
